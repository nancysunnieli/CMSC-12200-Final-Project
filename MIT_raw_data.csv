I can’t believe this is literally three months after they settled the class action lawsuit about not providing good 401(k) options. What, was that a slap on the wrist? I’ve only looked up one of the fun so far but it’s the index fund and it has .31% fees versus the .02% that the Vanguard fund it is replacing has. Can we *do* something?

Dear MIT 401(k) Plan Participant,

On behalf of MIT, the MIT Supplemental 401(k) Oversight Committee (“Committee”) regularly monitors and reviews the investment options offered in the 401(k) Plan. Recently, the Committee, with the guidance of its investment consultant, has decided to replace nine funds in the Plan with similar plans from the same asset classes. This fund change will occur during the evening of February 22, 2021. You are not required to take any action. The following is an explanation of the change and when it will occur. 

What Funds Will Be Changed?

The following funds will be replaced:

Current Fund to Be Eliminated	Replacement Fund

Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock U.S. Debt Income Fund F

Vanguard Total Stock Market Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock Russell 3000 Index Fund F

Vanguard Value Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Value Fund F

Vanguard Growth Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Growth Fund F

Vanguard Mid‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Mid Capitalization Equity Index Fund F

Vanguard Small‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 2000 Index Fund F

Vanguard US‐Real Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock FTSE EPRA/NARIET U.S. Index Fund F

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock MSCI ACWI ex‐U.S. IMI Index Fund F

Vanguard Emerging‐Markets Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund F

If you have invested in any of the current funds listed above, your investments will be moved automatically to the corresponding replacement fund. Your election to have future contributions invested in any of the current funds will also be automatically changed to the corresponding replacement funds. No action on your part is required.

The replacement funds are very similar to the current funds. They are of the same asset class; invest in many of the same securities; and follow a similar, though slightly different, market index. As always, we encourage all Plan participants to review their 401(k) account allocation regularly to confirm that it continues to be compatible with their retirement savings strategy.

Fact sheets for the new funds will be available in early February on the MIT Human Resources website at https://hr.mit.edu/benefits/401k and will also be posted on Fidelity’s NetBenefits website in late February.

When Is the Fund Change Happening?

The fund transfer will be made during the evening of February 22, 2021. Any fund transfers that you request before 4:00 pm EST on February 22, 2021, will be made before the current funds are replaced. Any of your investments that are automatically transferred to the new funds will be available for you to review on the Fidelity NetBenefits website after 7:00 am EST, February 23, 2021.

Why Are the Funds Being Changed?

The Committee regularly reviews the performance and fees of the investment options in the Plan. As part of this due diligence, it compared certain funds in the Plan to outside options with similar characteristics, evaluating their respective performance, index tracking variance, fund transaction costs and fund management fees. After completing its review, the Committee chose to replace the nine funds described above.

Information from Fidelity

Later this week, Fidelity will send you an announcement with detailed information about the fund changes. Please take the time to read the Fidelity announcement so you are fully informed about the changes taking place.

If you have questions, please contact the Fidelity Benefits Center at 877-648-7283 or MIT Benefits at benefits@mit.edu or 617-253-6151.

Something I was just concerned is that when I’m talking to other adMITs, it seems as if all the Course 18s know each other from math competitions/camps, and I haven’t done those things and I’m not currently part of those communities. And while I’ve studied a lot of university-level math in high school, I feel as if I have a weaker foundation since I feel I haven’t studied mathematics in as much depth as other people — though I guess this is a more minor point because I shouldn’t shy away from math just because it’s intimidating.

I’m also interested in the more applied side of things (rather than something like pure math research) and in particular math’s applications in the natural sciences or CS, so I’m thinking about whether a science major would be a better fit for me (or for CS I might just do 18C).

1608431351.0,0.0,26.0,"To the members of the MIT community,

Following the Goodwin Procter report on MIT’s interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, President Reif asked that I create a process to review its findings about Professor Seth Lloyd and to identify any appropriate action. I created a two-part review and decision-making process with two faculty committees: one to review facts and determine, based on those facts, whether Professor Lloyd violated any MIT policy, and the second to recommend disciplinary action, if necessary. I write today to share the results of this intensive two-stage effort and the decision I have reached. 

Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that I am taking the unusual step of sharing this information with our entire community because of the unique public nature of the case and its impacts. Professor Lloyd knows that I am taking this step, and he understands and accepts that the outcome of this disciplinary process should be shared openly.

The Review Panel

I assembled a panel of five senior faculty leaders from across the Institute and asked them to determine if Professor Lloyd violated MIT policies. The members of the panel were Professor Rohan Abeyaratne, Institute Professor Daron Acemoglu, Institute Professor Penny Chisholm, Materials Science and Engineering Department Head Jeffrey Grossman, and Dean of Science Nergis Mavalvala (chair). The panel members reviewed the Goodwin report as well as other documents they deemed relevant and met with a number of individuals, including the Goodwin fact-finders and Professor Lloyd, several times.  

Based on this review, a majority of the members found that, in connection with donations he received from Epstein in 2012, Professor Lloyd violated MIT’s conflict of interest policy (Policies &amp; Procedures 4.4) by failing to inform MIT that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that, in doing so, he violated MIT’s policy on faculty misconduct (Policies &amp; Procedures 3.4.2). A minority of the members could not conclude one way or the other that his actions violated the conflict of interest policy. 

The full panel further determined that he did not violate any MIT policies in accepting a gift from Epstein in 2005–2006 and a donation in 2017. The panel members did not find that Professor Lloyd tried to circumvent the MIT vetting process nor that he sought to conceal the name of the donor. They did conclude, however, that he failed to reveal crucial information about Epstein’s background to anyone at MIT.

The Evaluation Committee

The panel submitted its findings to a separate evaluation committee consisting of Dean of Engineering Anantha Chandrakasan, Mechanical Engineering Department Head Evelyn Wang, Physics Department Head Peter Fisher, Mechanical Engineering Associate Department Head Pierre Lermusiaux, and Faculty Chair Rick Danheiser. The evaluation committee convened several times, including meetings with the review panel members and with Professor Lloyd. Based on the panel’s conclusions, the evaluation committee recommended a set of disciplinary actions, which they stated ""focused on Professor Lloyd’s poor judgment and the impact of his actions on the community, which he may not have yet fully appreciated.""

My Decision

After conferring with senior administrative and faculty leaders, as well as the two committees, I have decided to implement the recommended disciplinary actions. 

For a period of five years, a set of disciplinary actions will limit Professor Lloyd’s compensation, his ability to engage in solicitation of donors and foundations, and his involvement in first-year undergraduate advising, and will impose several other restrictions on normal privileges accorded to a faculty member. In addition, Professor Lloyd will be expected to undergo training on professional conduct before resuming certain activities on campus, including teaching. 

These steps cannot undo the harm done. Professor Lloyd’s failure to share what he knew about Epstein’s conviction when he accepted his 2012 donations was unacceptable. His interactions with Epstein and certain of his actions surrounding acceptance of the donations serve to highlight the importance of the current Institute-wide effort to develop clearer guidelines for engaging with donors. 

I recognize that many in our community remain deeply disturbed by the interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and that some will be disappointed by this decision. In addition, for some, this outcome may renew past pain. If you feel you would benefit from support or guidance at this time, you can find a range of resources here.

I would like to close by extending my gratitude to the entire MIT community for your engagement, your candor, and your care for MIT.

In some departments, all classes and advising will be online, but this does not matter.  Because this requirement did not exist in the Fall, there are students in other countries with long-term leases, children in schools, spouses with jobs, no visa, US bank account or arrangement for local housing, whose plans are suddenly upended. The text makes clear that this policy change is for bureaucratic convenience of MIT and not a mandate from the government.  Within MIT, the decision was apparently made without consulting the departments. You can imagine how many students are freaking out. 

The new policy is [https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/) but since that site is restricted to MIT users only, I copied relevant text below.

**Graduate Students**  
RA, TAs, and Fellows: ***Graduate students with RA, TA, or fellowship appointments in Spring 2021 are being asked to return/come to the U.S. by January 30, 2021, in order to maintain their appointments***. A graduate student may be eligible to conduct their RA,TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad only if:

* Visa delays, travel restrictions, border closures, and other COVID-related factors prevent their travel to the U.S.; 
* The student or a member of the student’s household has been instructed by a medical provider not to travel to the U.S. for medical reasons; or
* The student is caring for a family member with COVID-19 or other illness.

If a graduate student with an RA, TA, or fellowship appointment is unable to return to/enter the U.S. for the above reasons, and they meet the other criteria listed below (see FAQ), the student should contact their graduate administrator who will submit an [intake form](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6txpJ8RUbGpbY9v) for the student’s remote international appointment.

**These requests will be reviewed individually to determine what options, if any, may be available to the student. Therefore, any student who believes they will need to purse their RA, TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad in Spring 2021 should immediately begin working with their department/program.**

Hourly Paid Appointments: Graduate students are not permitted to have hourly-paid appointments from outside the U.S. during Spring 2021 term. Intake forms should not be submitted for these students.  


**Why is MIT changing its guidelines for remote student appointments conducted from outside the U.S.?**  
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, MIT has supported hundreds of students pursuing their appointments remotely from abroad. As we explained in our [previous guidance and FAQs](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/), these remote international appointments pose a number of logistical, compliance, and financial challenges for both MIT and those working remotely abroad. To address these challenges, MIT set up a new process in May to review and facilitate these appointments on a temporary basis. The process was updated in August to include specific guidance for the Fall 2020 term.

MIT has reviewed and approved over 800 requests for students to pursue their appointments from outside the U.S. Many of these requests were for students who remained in the U.S at the start of the pandemic, but who wished to return home to pursue their studies and appointments in their home communities.

We are pleased that so many students were able to pursue their appointments this summer and fall from the locations that worked best for them. Unfortunately, given the increasing challenges posed by these international appointments—including the duration of many of these appointments, the fluid situation relating to the pandemic, and the relevant external guidance—we need to modify our approach beginning with the Spring 2021 term.",mit,New residency requirement sprung on graduate students,40.0,0.89

Question: For other classes in prior semesters (e.g. 8.02) there have been methods to anonymously express concerns about a class through the piazza forum. I (and I believe other students also (cf. below)) wish to anonymously express my concerns about 7.06, or to express my concerns in a safe setting. Are there ways in which to do this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Rant: In my opinion, the tests (93% of the grade) in 7.06 are horribly made. For those not in the class this semester, the questions are extremely vague but graded via a hyper-specific rubric while simultaneously docking for any extraneous information (in whatever way they define that based on the rubric, because again, the questions are very vague). For each of the 7.06 exams so far, I think they were content wise easy, and feel like I did well on them. However, each time, I was hit with an extra minus 10-15% for obscure/(extremely) nitpicky reasons. 

I believe students have complained in class about this before, as there was an email from the instructors with a proposed ""solution"" to this problem: to ask clarification questions about vaguely phrased problems DURING the exam via a google forum. In addition to the fact that the onus should not be on the students to design questions well (and that it can take up time that is supposed to be used on solving the exam), this is also unhelpful, as sometimes questions ask about something specific but have supposed rubric ""answers"" containing what I would consider entirely extraneous information. Basically, we don't know what questions to ask about the badly phrased problems because while taking the test they seem normal, only when comparing them with the rubric do they become respectively vague, unintuitive, or unclear.\* \*with respect to what the rubric was looking for 

I have for a little bit now stopped studying the biology for this class as much/attending class and instead focused on trying to figure out what the instructors want from me on tests (this is something I used to do in high school, and I hate that I have to do it now) -- this has actually helped my grade go up, not down. Singlehandedly this class has made me want to change majors as, although I love biology, I don't feel like focusing more on ""test-taking"" than learning in the future. I didn't have this issue in 7.05 or 7.03 and hope 7.06 is a one-off.",mit,How to express concerns about a class (7.06) that does not have a piazza forum on which to do so anonymously + rant,13.0,0.86

Dear Faculty Colleagues,

We write to let you know about a decision regarding collaborations  with Aramco, a founding member of the MIT Energy Initiative. After  thorough review and consultations within MIT and Aramco, Aramco’s  membership in MITEI will not be renewed, and new sponsored engagements  between MIT and Aramco will not be considered at this time.

Within MIT, this outcome was informed by extensive consultations and  community input over the past year and a half, and by specific  recommendations from the [International Advisory Committee (IAC)](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/international-advisory-committee), input from the [Ad Hoc Faculty Committee on Guidelines for Outside Engagements](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/ad-hoc-faculty-committee-guidelines-outside-engagements#:~:text=The%20Ad%20Hoc%20Committee%20on%20Guidelines%20for%20Outside%20Engagements%20will,MIT%20community%20during%20Spring%202020.&amp;text=Several%20members%20of%20the%20ad,ensure%20coordination%20in%20their%20work), and review by the Senior Risk Group. A full description of this process appeared in the May issue of the [Faculty Newsletter](https://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/325/lester.html).

Aramco has been a valued research partner for MIT. It is a technical  leader in many areas of engineering and science, and it has provided  many valuable research opportunities for MIT faculty and students which  have contributed to advances in fundamental energy science and  technology. Our researchers have also forged productive individual  working relationships with their Aramco colleagues.

We appreciate the thoughtful consideration that has been given to  this matter by faculty committees and groups and by individual members  of the community.

Sincerely,

Cornell University initially failed to report to U.S. authorities more than $1.2 billion in foreign funds it has received in recent years, including $760 million related to its campus in Qatar and about $1 million in contracts from Chinese telecom company Huawei Technologies Co., the U.S. Education Department indicated in its latest report on schools and foreign contracts.

The names of Cornell and other universities are redacted in a report the department released Tuesday, but are identifiable based on other details provided in the report and related correspondence by the department with the schools.

The 34-page report provides an update to a broad investigation the Education Department undertook last year into whether U.S. universities are appropriately reporting all foreign contracts and gifts that total more than $250,000 in one year. It isn’t illegal to take such funds, but universities are obligated to disclose them under a statute that is decades old but hasn’t been vigorously enforced in past years.

The department said Tuesday it planned to condition access to participation in federal student-loan programs on compliance with foreign-funding obligations.

The government has expressed concern that foreign money may come with strings attached, provide foreign governments improper access to sensitive research or limit academic freedom in some programs.

“U.S. institutions are technological treasure troves where leading and internationally competitive fields, such as nanoscience, are booming. For too long, these institutions have provided an unprecedented level of access to foreign governments and their instrumentalities in an environment lacking transparency and oversight by the industry, the Department, and our partner agencies,” the Education Department said in its report.

More on U.S. Reviews of Foreign Funding

Education Department Investigating Harvard, Yale Over Foreign Funding (Feb. 13)
The Justice Department has been cracking down on violations of a law that requires lobbyists for foreign nationals and governments to publicly disclose that work. A top Republican fundraiser pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a related charge.

Education Department investigators found that “many large and well-resourced institutions of higher education have aggressively pursued and accepted foreign money,” while failing to comply with reporting obligations, according to the new report.

“Evidence suggests institutional decision-making is generally divorced from any sense of obligation to our taxpayers or concern for our American national interests, security, or values,” the report added.

The report said a school, identifiable as Georgetown University, has worked with the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, “derived $2,360,807” from an arrangement that demonstrated “significant intermingling” with China, and supported an academic exchange with Communist officials through the central committee’s Party School.

A Georgetown spokeswoman said the school’s tax filings show a nearly identical dollar amount in expenditures in the region, but not gifts or contracts from foreign entities, and that the details in the report were “a bit puzzling to us.”

U.S. universities have generally defended their international collaborations and said the agency’s reporting requirements were unclear.

A Cornell spokesman acknowledged the university’s past errors in reporting and said it had undertaken significant efforts since July 2019 to file accurate disclosures of the foreign funds.

Since 2019, the Education Department has opened investigations into a dozen top universities including Harvard University and Yale University, finding that U.S. universities failed to report at least $6.5 billion in such funds.

The new report details information the agency received from Georgetown, Texas A&amp;M University, Cornell, Rutgers University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland. The other schools under investigation are continuing to provide information or have yet to provide documents, the report said.

One school, identifiable as Cornell, admitted that it failed to document its institution in Qatar in previous reports to the department, and said it was dumbfounded about how to explain the error, the report said. The university has a branch of its medical school in the Gulf country.

Multiple schools also belatedly reported receiving millions of dollars from Huawei, the report said, referring to the tech giant whose equipment U.S. national security officials have warned could be used for espionage, which the company denies.

American universities largely stopped taking Huawei funds by 2018 based on the U.S. concerns, but many top schools had previously entered into extensive contracts with the company, the report said. The university identifiable as MIT, for example, held around $11 million in contracts and agreements with Huawei since 2013, ranging from research agreements to donations for specific projects and programs, the report said.",mit,MIT and others being investigated for not reporting foreign ties.,34.0,0.85

So I’m a current freshman here at MIT and just wanted to ask a question. With me wanting to double major in Aerospace Engineering and Physics to try to get both a systems Engineering and technical science background in my undergrad (but also because I love all of it) and after seeing how other students do it successfully without dying, its something I’m pretty set on committing to here at MIT. 

However, I started looking into the Material Science Department here and after poking my head into some of the research labs (MIT Nano) and letting my love for chemistry come out, I’m now considering maybe minoring in Mat Sci along with my double major (because I love Aero/Astro and Physics a lot more).

The way I’m looking at it would be if it gets too stressful and it’s not fun anymore I’d drop it, but what do you guys think about actually trying to do that? I thought it would be awesome to not only get Engineering education, but also a good knowledge base in chemistry and physics as well! 

Would this be a great thing to enter industry with or do you guys think it wouldn’t be worth it?

As part of its pandemic policies, MIT issued a Return to Work on Campus policy, detailing the safety requirements for being on campus, such as completing the daily health attestation and the wearing of face coverings.

To aid in making quick and consistent responses to alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy, MIT will follow a new process, summarized below. This new process (Touchstone login required) applies to allegations against faculty and staff; a similar expedited Committee on Discipline process is in place for allegations against students.

The key provisions are:

Expedited review process

All complaints of alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy are forwarded to the Manager of Institutional Compliance at covidcompliance@mit.edu.
The Manager of Institutional Compliance, in consultation with the OGC and others, will work with the DLC to find facts and appropriately respond.
The alleged violator will be informed and given an opportunity to respond.
Decision making

Low-level violations: DLC will determine appropriate response and/or sanction.
Other violations:
By faculty, other academic, postdoctoral, or research staff: Provost or VP for Research, in consultation with the school dean, will determine response/sanctioning.
By other staff: VP for HR will determine response/sanctioning.
Guidelines for Response/Sanctions

The decision maker – the DLC, Provost, VP for Research, or VP for Human Resources – will refer to the following guidelines when determining the response/sanctions. That said, each case is unique, and these guidelines are not prescriptive; they are intended to offer a basis from which to make a decision about a case. The decision-maker should consider the totality of the circumstances, including aggravating and mitigating factors, when determining sanctions.

 

Type of Violation

Potential Outcome

First-time face covering

Written reminder of policy, and warning that additional violation of this requirement could result in discipline.

 

First time “low level”

Disciplinary written warning.

Second time “low level”

OR

First time “medium level”

One-day disciplinary suspension without pay or access.

Repetition of above categories and
“high level” violations
Five-day disciplinary suspension without pay, or termination of employment. If individual is a tenured faculty member, referral to Provost for appropriate sanction.

 

KEY:

Types of “low-level” violations: one-time face covering or social distancing violation.
Types of “medium-level” violations: one-time access to building without approved access, failure to test, or second incident of a failure to wear a face covering.
Types of “high-level” violations: violating quarantine, repeated violations of the above categories.

From: Suzy M. Nelson, Vice President and Dean for Student Life  
Sent: Monday, September 7, 2020 12:00  
Subject: A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies
 
YOU NEED TO KNOW: off-campus event prohibition; expedited disciplinary process for Covid policy violations; success depends on all of us!

Dear graduate students living off campus,

This is an unusual fall semester as MIT manages a pandemic, and the United States and countries around the world deal with the mounting toll of Covid cases.  Against this backdrop, there is continued unrest in cities across the country in the wake of police violence, systemic inequity, and the deaths of too many Black Americans. Further exacerbating these situations are natural disasters in the country's southern and western regions and a contentious national election.

To all of you anxious about any of these issues, know that MIT is here for you. Please reach out if you need to talk with someone.

MIT's plan for moving forward during the pandemic is guided by science and common sense. As I detail in a message I sent to graduate students living on campus, life at MIT is different now. But, if we work together and adhere to and have patience with Covid policies--both from MIT and in the communities where you live and work now--we can meet the challenges ahead.

Events, parties, and gatherings off campus. Don't organize or attend off-campus events, parties, or gatherings until further notice--they are a leading cause of Covid hotspots on college campuses. MIT will take swift disciplinary action in response to violations of MIT Covid policies through an expedited Committee on Discipline process. Students who attend or host off-campus parties, events, or gatherings may face disciplinary action including potential suspension or loss of future campus access.

Campus Access. Students living off-campus who have not been granted official access to MIT facilities through Covid Pass for academic and research purposes may not be on campus or in campus buildings at any time. Students who do have official access through Covid Pass may use academic and research facilities they are cleared to enter, DAPER indoor and outdoor facilities (with a valid membership), and designated outdoor common areas in groups no larger than the posted occupancy. Only current MIT Housing residents may enter the Student Center and use its foodservice facilities. This chart may help clarify who has access to campus facilities. 

Additional Policies and Updates

As you can see, we take student health, wellness, and safety seriously. Please review The Mind and Hand Book, which contains essential information on standards of behavior and student life policies. Other important policies include:

  - MIT's community standards such as the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act statement;
  - Discrimination, harassment, and Title IX resources that help make our campus safe; and
  - MIT's policy against hazing to support a safe and welcoming environment for all.

The success of the semester depends on every one of us! 

The Institute's decision to stick with our reopening plan is grounded in our confidence that every MIT community member will rise to the challenge.

Our plan for the fall and beyond is being put to the test. Working together, we can pass it with flying colors.

Best,  
Suzy",mit,A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies,10.0,0.92

I'm an incoming freshman, and I want to double major in math and physics. I successfully got credit for 18.01 and 18.02 and plan on trying to take the 18.03 ASE, but I'm mostly concerned about physics. In hindsight, I know I made some mistakes on the 8.01 ASE (silly things like forgetting a minus sign, but I'm not sure if I will be heavily docked for this), and, while I did self-study a lot of E&amp;M and Quantum Mechanics, I figured I should probably take the courses since I likely didn't have the same rigor as the MIT courses, especially since my only high school physics course was non-AP (my school didnt offer it) and wasn't particularly rigorous.

So, my question is this: is it still feasible for me to pursue a double major even if I have to start from 8.01? Would I be able to finish in 4 years? Are passing the ASEs important as far as completing the graduation requirements for a major, or do they just free up space for other classes that are taken out of interest rather than necessity?

I'm hoping for some insight into what classes to take. Should I just knock out all 3 GIRs my first semester? Or would that be a waste of P/NR? If I don't do the GIRs, what other classes should I take? Any suggestions from Course 6? I'm trying to ASE out of 6.0001, but I've heard that 6.0002 is a quarter class, so I'm not sure what I would take for that other quarter in order not to waste credits while under the credit limit?

1594954832.0,0.0,0.0,"A friend and MIT grad wrote to me yesterday, “I don’t know if the Media Lab is redeemable at all.” This in the wake of the bombshell Ronan Farrow piece in the New Yorker, reporting that the Media Lab under its director Joi Ito had covered up a much closer relationship with Jeffrey Epstein than previously revealed. Ito promptly resigned.

The Media Lab has always occupied a curious place in the tech world. According to itself, it “transcends known boundaries and disciplines by actively promoting a unique, antidisciplinary culture that emboldens unconventional mixing and matching of seemingly disparate research areas … In its earliest years, some saw the Media Lab as a house of misfits. Here, the emphasis was on building; the Lab’s motto was “demo or die.””

It ceased being viewed as a house of misfits a long time ago. Instead it has become perceived as a hyper-prestigious, creme-de-la-creme entity, a weird mixture of counterculture and patrician, seen as home to the best (and coolest) of the best, whose annual budget has tripled from $25 million in 2009 to $75 million in 2019. It seems fair to estimate that roughly a billion inflation-adjusted dollars have been spent on it since its birth in 1986.

While it’s an academic institution it has always been exceptionally business-oriented. “At first glance, much of the Media Lab’s research may seem tangential to current business realities, but for more than 30 years, the Lab has demonstrated that seemingly “far out” research can find its way into the most conventional—and useful—applications … The Media Lab has spawned dozens of new products by our members, and over 150 start-up companies,” to quote, again, them.

And yet. One can’t help but notice. Consider its basic ingredients:

+    founded in 1986, as Moore’s Law began to hit us all, and tech began the exponential growth that has made it the world’s dominant force
+    at the most prestigious technical university on the entire planet
+    in a position to pick and choose from the brightest minds of its generation
+    allotted $1 billion to spend over those thirty years of hockey-stick growth

Given all that, wouldn’t you have expected … well … a whole lot more than what it has actually accomplished?

=== ==== =====

Given all that, wouldn’t you have expected … well … a whole lot more than what it has actually accomplished?

Because that list of accomplishments is surprisingly scrawny. Take its spin-off companies. Here’s its list. Trivia question: how many Media Lab spinoffs have gone public, without merging or being acquired, in its 33 years of existence? As far as I can tell, the answer is one, and even that comes with a sizable asterisk: the Art Technology Group, which didn’t start building products until six years after it spun out (it was a consultancy), IPOd during the first dot-boom, and was eventually acquired by Oracle.

There are companies you’ll recognize on that list. Well, there’s one: BuzzFeed. Yes, really. There are a few others of note. Harmonix, makers of Rock Band. Makani Power, acquired by Alphabet six years ago. Elance, which became Upwork and then had its platform phased out. Jana. Formlabs, Otherlab, The Echo Nest, all of which I think are great, but none of which I would have heard of if not for some personal connections. One Laptop Per Child, a bad idea a decade ago and a forgotten one now. And, notably, E Ink, the Media Lab’s one definite, unambiguous big win … back in 1996.

It’s not nothing, but it’s so much less than you’d expect, given its ingredients. It’s certainly no Bell Labs, or Xerox PARC, or even Y Combinator, and I say that as someone who is less of a YC enthusiast than most of the Valley.

OK, I hear you arguing, but they’re a basic research facility! Spinoff companies are not their true measure of success! Sure. Fine. So let’s take a hard look at their own list of their top 30 tech products or platforms (PDF). Aside from E Ink — which, again, was 23 years ago — doesn’t that look a lot like a list of occasionally interesting, but fundamentally limited and/or niche, technologies? Doesn’t it seem rather utterly devoid of any significant impact on the world?

Wouldn’t you have expected so, so much more?

Criticisms that the Lab is more about style and sizzle than serious substance are not exactly new. Nor are they old: here’s a piece condemning its recent “personal food computer” as smoke and mirrors that doesn’t actually work. This “Hunter S. Negroponte” piece dates back to the 1990s. It’s satire, but if you read it, you’ll likely find you can’t help but raise your eyebrows and wonder just how far back the Media Lab’s systemic problems go.

Maybe if it hadn’t been a “plutocratic friendocracy,” to quote former Media Lab faculty, and it had actually systemically favored the best and brightest and most innovative, regardless of background or personal connection — maybe then things would have been very different. Maybe it would actually have been what it pretended to be for all this time.",mit,E15,0.0,0.46

Normally I would just live in Cambridge, but given that Cambridge is relatively expensive, much of the MIT community will not be there, and access to MIT facilities will be limited, I don't really see the point if things are remote.

This is so frustrating to see. As a student I’ve switched from online to seated over the semesters. So these students would be deported for a semester then next semester when they take one seated they’d be allowed to come back, but then the following semester if they take all online they’d be deported again? Sounds like a huge waste of time and people’s money traveling that much. Especially since we are in new territory and who knows how long universities will be doing mostly online, this may go on for a couple semesters.

Are international students who take online only courses normally granted F1 visas?  No, but international students who take courses at Harvard and MIT are, and Harvard and MIT don't normally go 100% online.

 [Williams College](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/780717Z:US), the richest liberal arts school in the U.S., is reducing its cost by 15% for families on a one-time basis for the coming academic year and canceling sports competition and travel for the season as the coronavirus upends higher education.

The changes come “in recognition of the extraordinary circumstances and of this academic year and the uncertainty we face in the year ahead,” the Williamstown, Massachusetts, school said in a [statement](https://president.williams.edu/writings-and-remarks/letters-from-the-president/announcing-our-plan-for-fall-2020/) Monday. 

“This reduction recognizes the fact that the pandemic and associated challenges are requiring us to cancel winter study as well as fall athletics competition and many student activities, among other opportunities that we usually encourage families to expect as part of their student’s education,” school President Maud Mandel said.

Schools across the U.S. are coping with uncertainty for the year that begins in August or September as it’s largely unclear whether in-person courses will be offered given the rise in Covid-19 cases. Students at dozens of schools have already balked at the full price for last semester’s tuition with months of online classes, suing for billions of dollars in refunds.

“In higher education, we’re trained to believe that expensive is good,” said [Robert Kelchen](https://www.shu.edu/profiles/robertkelchen.cfm), an associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University. “Now, in this economic crisis, families are more price-sensitive than they have been.”

The move by Williams, which has about 2,100 students, may put pressure on other selective liberal arts schools to follow.

“For this year, it may be less expensive for the colleges to do because a lot of students who pay full price are international students, and they may not be counting on them,” Kelchen said.",mit,Williams College decreases tuition by 15% for 2020-21 academic year,40.0,0.86

1592125317.0,0.0,6.0,"Throwaway to avoid persecution, but I just watched the documentary of Jeffrey Epstein on Netflix... absolutely disgusting. Not only him but also all the collaborators. After doing some research about the consequences to the other players in this story, it came to my attention the role played by MIT. In particular the support to Jeffrey Epstein and the lack of regrets shown by the institution and its members.

It came ta my attention, in particular, the role of MIT Media Lab and Joi Ito, who was fired. But my surprise was the story of  Neri Oxman, whose work has been produced with money from a network of pedophilia, and she still teaching in MIT and representing the values of the institution!

For those who don't know the story, Jeffrey Epstein supported her work through donations, AFTER he was charged the first time for child trafficking, and he was a known child abuser. Apparently, his strategy was to donate to many people with good reputation but lacking ethical principles, to present himself as a philanthropist to the judge. When the money started flowing to the lab, one of his students told her that he felt uncomfortable using such money. She lied, telling him that she had ensured that no money from Epstein was being used. So, the students, who demonstrated more ethical values than her, continued working. Later it was discovered that she accepted the money with the condition that nobody knew, but not only she knew but also lied to her students to use them, and MIT resources, to produce presents for a pedophile, so money keeps flowing.

So, if you went to MIT, there are some chances you made presents for convicted (but wealthy) pedophiles.

MIT did nothing, tried to hide everything under the carpet, and had her superstar professor as an example of women in STEM. Remember, if you are a woman in STEM, MIT thinks the model you should follow is that everything is allowed, even if everything means supporting sexual abuse of girls.

I'm still confused about how MIT as an institution or its students and faculty bodies have decided to look away instead of on deeply clean your institution. But MIT is not the only one, surprisingly Netflix, who just made a 4 hours documentary to denounce Jeffery Epstein's case, did it a few months after releasing a chapter of Abstract highlighting the work of your beloved MIT professor. A work produced with money from a known pedophile by someone who knew the origin of the money! Cynicism over 9000!

The tolerance to child abuse by MIT is disgusting and disappointing. So, next time that you walk in the Media Lab and see the last artistic installation of one of your professors at the Media Lab lobby think about this: that has been built with money from child abuse.

------------------------------------------------------------------
### My experience with the FEE: Utter Failure.

I've spoken English my whole life. In the summer of 2008, I had to do the Freshman Essay Evaluation.

The topics were enjoyable to read and think about: The security of electronic voting machines and the ethics of paying human research subjects.

I could not do the writing. No words onto paper. No words onto keyboard. I..... just. could. not. write.
This had happened to me before. I sat for hours in my room, trying to get words to come out. None.
Usually, after enough time digging my nails into my skin, mentally shouting at myself to just buckle down and get it done, and eventually some tears.... something would unblock and I'd be able to write a first draft. Never any time to edit it, but oh well.

That summer, after 9 days of misery, I turned in nothing.

I figured that I'd learn to overcome this by taking the technical writing class at MIT. Fun fact: no. The professor who teaches that class is _not_ a psychotherapist. Neither are the staff of the MIT writing center.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Correct, non-actionable advice: Just get words onto paper.

Good writing comes from editing -- molding clay into solid bricks and stacking them on top of each other. You need to have some words and paragraphs to mould and push into a good structure.

People will often phrase this as ""Don't care what someone would think; Just write a [crappy first draft](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf) to get your thoughts on paper"". Fun fact: no. If you only imagine yourself doing a crappy job, you will not be very motivated to do it.

So how do you get some clay? How do you lead your brain to make the words? 

------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to actually execute that: Have a conversation.

Brains do things that they find rewarding.

If you have writers' block, you might notice that you're perfectly fine talking with a human about the topic. That is because you can see the social reward in real time. You're turning vague notions into organized thoughts for the benefit of another person and (if they are paying attention to you), you can see their understanding. You might be fine texting someone or getting on reddit and commenting on a thread. Same thing: You imagine them listening to what you say and reacting.

Notice that commenting on reddit is a form of writing. Notice you're not writing crap, You're having a conversation. Even if you're shitposting, you're just having a boisterous conversation.

If you do this over IM with someone who is interested in the topic or prompt, you can then copy-paste your words and have the clay to mold into an essay.

If you do this over audio and record it (especially with an auto-transcription app like [otter](https://otter.ai/), you can kinda do the same.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### What to do if you can't talk to someone -- Reward Loops 

I am a software engineer and we have technique for writing code even when we're worried that it will be crap or we don't know how it should be structured.

#### Test Driven Development

The technique is to repeat some small simple steps:

1. Write a program that does literally nothing.

2. Write a tiny program to check if the first program does a tiny bit.

3. The second program is a ""test"". Run it so you know that it says ""nope"".

4. Change the first program to do a tiny bit.

5. Run the test to see that it says ""yep"". Feel successful. 😃

6. Write a third tiny program to check if the first program does a tiny bit more.

7. Run this new test to see that it says ""nope.""

8. Add a tiny bit more to your first program...

Continue like this, writing tests and first running them so you know that they actually say ""nope"" when a feature is missing or buggy. You end up with the program you want and a bunch of tiny programs that automatically check that it works.

Notice that this technique keeps putting a small step of a goal right in front of you, letting you try things and observe the results, and showing you when you succeed at it.

[This is the same thing that video games do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGL5YGcAxEI&amp;t=22).

#### How to start a core reward loop for writing.

In order to feel rewarded for making progress, you need to imagine that you're succeeding at something. 

Succeeding at what? An essay asks you to answer a question. 

So type your own question and respond to it. Type the first response that comes to mind, even if that is another question. Just keep responding, writing questions guided by your curiosity or confusion and answers as you see them. 

Set a 10-minute [timer](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/) before you start this. 

At the end of the 10 minutes, notice if any questions seem relevant to the assignment. Copy those to a new page and start again. If your questions are along the lines of ""Why am I such a lazy piece of shit?"", then save that file somewhere else, open a new page, then get up and go for a walk or do some exercise. Come back to this with a fresh mindset.

Just keep typing questions and answers. You'll likely notice yourself wanting to give longer explanations to the questions and wanting to re-frame the questions. Once you've started doing that, you're plugged-in: you've begun to imagine a conversation partner and what they need to hear to satisfy their curiosity. You've got your reward model and it has started giving you incremental signs-of-success.

[There is a reason why Plato wrote the Dialogues as...a dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_dialogue#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20Socratic%20dialogues,which%20Socrates%20is%20a%20character.)

[There is a reason why the first great works of literature come from oral tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry)

Writing is a technology we humans had to build _on top of conversation_.

So keep the conversation going and you'll soon have enough hefty concepts for a first draft. Feel free to lengthen that timer from 10 minutes to 20 or 30 in the style of the [pomodoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0k0TQfZGSc). After several paragraphs, you might find yourself getting a bit confused and wanting to re-structure your sections so they make more sense to you. That is fine to do. You might want to make side-notes on a piece of physical paper or draw a diagram. Thats cool too. Just keep moving and keep a regular rhythm of checking in on yourself to see if you're still having a conversation that might be relevant. You are making clay. It is fine that some of it won't be used.

### A note about the question ""Why"".

Yes, this does mean that you might start out asking ""why does anybody care?"" about the assignment. You might have previously asked a teacher and heard ""Just write the essay."" Your parent might have told you ""Because I said so"". You might have learned to stifle asking ""Why?"" in certain situations. 

You are now an adult. 

Your whole life is optional.^([1])

You have the freedom to pursue an answer to ""Why"". No particular person is obligated to answer you, but you can go ask someone else.

You can also just decide not to do something if you don't find a compelling reason for doing it.

* The implementation of testing, tracing, and treatment protocols is essential to mitigating the risk of community spread of COVID-19.
* There will be ongoing physical distancing in classroom, research lab, residential, and work spaces. 
   * Roughly 100 fall subjects rely on access to the physical campus space to achieve the subject learning objectives. Roughly 3,000 students enroll in these subjects in a typical year. Physical distancing constraints in our instructional spaces will limit the in-person teaching that can be done on campus, and require that we teach and learn in different ways (e.g., fewer students at a time in teaching labs, design studios, project, and performance spaces and potential for broader use of the day for class hours).
   * Much of the curriculum (lectures, recitations, seminars) will be offered remotely in the fall and perhaps the spring as well, even when some or many students may reside on campus.
   * In the undergraduate residence halls, use of common spaces will be limited, food service options will include take-out services, and cook-for-yourself programming will likely be suspended during this period. P-setting and interactions with peers, house team members, and GRAs will be highly constrained under physical distancing. Recreational programming will be online or offered in de-densified settings. Access to common amenities such as gyms, lounges, and study rooms will be limited.
   * On-campus office spaces in which staff interact with faculty, students, and other staff (e.g., DSL headquarters, DAPER check-in, OVC headquarters, SFS, S\^3, OGE, MIT Medical, etc.) will need to be revamped to facilitate physical distancing. Examples include removing some furniture and chairs, putting up Plexiglass barriers and tape in lobby areas, and removing vending machines and reusable kitchen items. 
* Ongoing restricted access to MIT buildings will be necessary.
   * The campus will be allocated into sectors that will be entered by MIT ID-card based access. This will be less convenient and will require more planning to oneʼs day when coming to campus buildings to use on-campus resources. MIT is testing and adapting such approaches now with the existing on-campus population of residents, approved researchers, and campus support staff. 
* Not everyone will be able to or will choose to return to campus, even if permitted to do so. 
   * Some people fall into a high health risk category for COVID-19 or live with people who are high risk. Every member of the MIT community must do their part to protect these members of our community. Others may be impeded from being on campus due to travel restrictions and visa delays. Still other community members may have unique living situations where teaching, learning, and/or working are made more difficult by technology barriers, family responsibilities, and financial challenges. We must be agile and able to make arrangements for individuals who are remote.
   * The limited availability of MIT-owned residential beds in a de-densified campus setting poses a significant constraint. The Division of Student Life estimates the availability of 1,900 beds at one student per room and a 3:1 student/water closet ratio. Securing hotel beds may increase our capacity figures but doing so adds significant costs and presents potential negative implications for the student experience. 
* We will maintain our commitment to high-quality education, student support, and co-curricular and experiential learning opportunities in every option. We will revise academic policies and regulations to respond to the plan that is ultimately put in place.
   * Consistent with MITʼs mission, we will deliver “an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery”. We will ensure that students progress towards their degrees, minimize subject cancellations, and minimize pre-requisite disruptions. We have developed optimization methods to rapidly re-plan class schedules to achieve our objectives. 
* We will maintain our commitment to excellence in research and [graduate education](https://covid19.mit.edu/safe-gradual-return-to-campus-for-graduate-students). [The research ramp up process is designed to ensure this objective.](https://covid19.mit.edu/initial-process-for-on-campus-research-ramp-up)
* Creating a dedicated isolation space for students and other campus residents who test positive for COVID-19 is necessary in any of the scenarios being considered, as is a plan to scale back the reopening if community health and safety concerns necessitate a reduction in campus density levels again.

**What We Donʼt Know Yet**

*There are certain things we cannot know or guarantee at this moment, and there are certain questions we havenʼt answered yet. Any option for the fall and beyond will have several uncertainties in common, including:*

* The trajectory of the pandemic and the timeline for the development of a cost-effective, widely available vaccine and/or therapeutics.
   * We donʼt know what the public health situation will be within the city or state in the fall, including when or if a second wave will occur, when a vaccine or therapeutics will be available or once available, if we will be able to procure large enough quantities to immunize the entire community. Nevertheless, we must be prepared for dramatically changing health conditions in the next academic year (positive or negative). 
   * Based on what we know now, antibody testing is not likely to be helpful in the short to medium term for planning for return to campus but [may be helpful eventually](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19).   
* Community membersʼ willingness to comply with physical distancing rules in classroom, research lab, residential, and work spaces. 
   * We donʼt know how well students and the rest of the MIT community will follow physical distancing policies; some current residents would like [stricter rules, and others would like more relaxed rules](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6oqkxb6gipquxj/strengthen%20or%20relax%20housing%20policies.pdf?dl=0). 
* Who will be allowed to travel to campus, and the best decisions for which undergraduate students will return and when for options where only a fraction of the undergraduates are on campus at a given time.
   * For any case where only a fraction of the undergraduates are invited back to campus over a given period, we will have to make difficult choices about who to bring to campus and when, but we will seek to equally support and serve all of our students. We will also optimize our subject schedules to increase the ability of students to take the classes they need to progress academically. 
* Space availability to enable physical distancing on campus (in our academic spaces and undergraduate residence halls).
   * At current physical distancing guidelines, and taking into account the varied types of learning spaces and learning activities in MIT classes, we estimate that the academic campus can accommodate approximately 4,000 learners at a time. We could think of this as 4,000 students in classrooms/labs/studios/seminar rooms per day; or 8,000 if each student had a half-day on campus. Scheduling and judicious use of the hands-on-campus resource for in-person educational opportunities (e.g. lab, project and performance classes, design studios) for those who can be on campus will be important.  
   * Even as lectures, recitations, seminars, and large group gatherings are delivered remotely, individuals who choose to be on campus may benefit from physically-distanced, in-person interactions among others wearing face coverings, in medium-sized and large spaces (e.g., psetting, office hours, working on projects, practicing performances, etc.). Such spaces and the management of appropriate population density are under consideration now. 
   * We donʼt yet know how we will house and room residential students in a de-densified scenario and may need to explore the implications of securing hotel spaces and keeping some buildings (e.g., Burton Conner and Eastgate) in use to house graduate students, undergraduate students, and/or as isolation space. Nor do we know when the Site 4 and New Vassar residence halls will open following construction delays, but anticipate this will not be until January at the earliest (these buildings provide \~450 beds each of additional capacity).
* Short and long-term impacts on the wellbeing of community members.
   * While we will make every effort to create a positive and special living community on campus, some individuals may feel more isolated and have difficulties coping with the new normal. Others may have difficult living situations off-campus if they are remote.
* Short and long-term impacts on the residential education model and experience and co-curricular learning.
   * There are uncertain impacts on internships, and travel-related learning.
   * We donʼt know the extent of necessary changes to the academic calendar and curriculum. 
* Community responses and reactions to the options.
   * We donʼt know how many undergraduate and graduate students may wish to defer, take a leave of absence, or stay remote under the conditions in which MIT has to operate this fall. In a recent survey, [when asked about the housing options they were exploring for fall](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnzthf4xbxc3xhz/housing%20options%20students%20are%20exploring.pdf?dl=0), about a quarter of continuing undergraduates checked “I would probably stay where I am now if MIT has online instruction and reduced campus operations (e.g., restricted access to campus; emergency housing policies).”    
 

**Steps MIT Can Take**

*Keeping in mind the* [*guiding principles*](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/principles-values/) *and logistical, temporal, and financial realities, the following are examples of steps that MIT could decide to take that might impact the viability of the potential options.*

* Consider requiring [regular, community-wide testing, tracing, and treating](https://idss.mit.edu/research/idss-covid-19-collaboration-isolat/)
   * Consider requiring testing on arrival/re-entry to campus and periodically thereafter. MIT Medical would be able to collect specimens for up to 5,000 viral tests per week.
   * Consider requiring  use of a contact tracing app to facilitate testing, tracing, and treating [if we could ensure that it was accurate and could protect privacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01264-1).
   * Continue to provide quarantine spaces and care for students and other campus residents who have a positive COVID-19 test.
   * Continue to integrate the evolving information and protocols published in the literature into our processes for any testing, tracing, and treating as feasible and appropriate.
* Adopt new policies, procedures, and educational campaigns that promote recommended practices and support compliance with public health guidelines:
   * Enhance access to hand washing stations, hand sanitizer, face coverings and work activity-specific PPE; required access control for spaces, etc. consistent with our policies.
   * Enhance cleaning and stocking by staff who maintain facilities (e.g., more frequent cleaning and sanitizing schedule, restocking sanitizing wipe and hand sanitizer stations, etc.).
   * Establish and communicate work-at-home policies and expectations.
   * Establish and communicate expectations and protocols for being on campus (e.g., conduct meetings electronically, even when on campus; requirement to wear a face covering in any shared space; practice physical distancing; criteria to be eligible to return to campus; reminders through signage; training on new expectations; using health monitoring technology; etc.).
   * Redesign spaces to help maintain physical distance (e.g., remove furniture and chairs; Plexiglass barriers; removing vending machines and reusable kitchen items).
   * Establish remote, hybrid, and physically-distanced teaching, learning, and working options. 
* Teach, learn, and work in new modalities. 
   * The entire MIT community responded quickly and effectively on short notice to the pandemic in spring 2020. Going forward, we will have more time to carefully plan and prepare. We will continue to invest in existing and new academic and well-being support structures for our students; this includes, for example, our [student success coaches](http://news.mit.edu/2020/student-coaching-calls-pandemic-0501) and [other virtual support resources](https://covid19.mit.edu/virtual-student-support-resources).
   * We will redesign not only our formal curriculum but also co-curricular and experiential learning opportunities (e.g., UROP) so that we will continue to offer these exceptional parts of the MIT experience. For classes and experiences that typically require and rely on access to the physical campus space to achieve the subject learning objectives, we can explore and offer alternatives (e.g., mailing kits of parts home). 
* Implement a phased or staggered campus repopulation plan.
   * We can strictly limit visitors to campus. 
   * We plan to ramp up the research enterprise under the following parameters:
      * Reduced occupancy and density levels for our buildings and labs as prescribed by our medical and public health professionals. PI and DLC operating plans will align and be benchmarked against these levels. 
      * Only researchers and staff needing to use the physical campus will be allowed back during the ramp-up process. Clearly, this need is subjective and thus a period of comment and discussion with the faculty is underway to plan phases of research ramp up that would increase the number of MIT ID holders coming to campus to conduct research each day. Researchers and staff who can work remotely will continue to do so until conditions as determined by our medical and health professionals allow them to return to campus. 
      * Individual PIs and DLCs will be empowered to structure their research activities in response to these new occupancy and density levels. Priority should be given to activities that can easily be scaled up or scaled down if necessary.
      * Core facilities, shared resources, and other services will be made available to facilitate research activities broadly, provided they can function safely and within the predetermined limits regarding occupancy and density.
      * Access to buildings (and, where possible, individual spaces within buildings) will adhere to approved PI personnel plans; only those individuals who are approved to enter buildings will be allowed to do so and will do so through specific building access locations and protocols.
      * Anyone who chooses to participate in on-campus research can be supplied with face coverings or PPE if needed. Face coverings or masks will be required to be worn while working in MIT buildings. On-campus personnel will follow physical distancing protocols as described in PI space planning documents and DLC plans for common spaces. They can also submit to a daily health attestation as well as possible health monitoring and testing.
      * Researchers, students, and staff returning to campus to conduct or support research may be expected to enroll in an online environmental, health, and safety training course to learn about how to maintain a safe and clean work environment in the current COVID-19 era conditions. 
* Create and promote new modes of operating for student life and hands-on learning opportunities as well as community-building programs.
   * New virtual study lounges and other study spaces (remote and physically-distanced in person) could be used to promote academic belonging, peer-learning, and camaraderie. 
   * New campus organizations and events (e.g., discussion groups, representative bodies, etc.) can help anticipate and manage the range of issues that will arise in a physically distanced academic year. 
* Adapt MITʼs business operations to all options.
   * Essential campus services must be staffed according to acceptable campus density parameters and guidelines for safe working conditions and safe commuting. The research ramp-up plans, educational plans, and other MIT programs cannot create an unacceptable burden on these functions or these campus service staff.  
 

**Important Things to Consider for All Options**

*We realize that assessing the information on this site is, in MIT tradition, like drinking from a firehose. With that in mind, the list below succinctly presents the most crucial factors that informed our analysis of options and will need to be heeded in any adaptation to those options or in developing new ones.*

**Health Risk**

* Health risk to the MIT community 
* Health risk to the broader community beyond campus  
 

**Education and Student Experience**

* Quality of educational offerings  
* Quality of lab, project-based, performance classes, and other academic experiential learning (e.g., UROP)
* Student academic progression (e.g., numbers of potential schedule dislocations)
* Extracurricular and residential education (e.g., clubs, organizations, athletics, FSILGs, etc.)
* Impacts on student life goals (e.g., desire to be with friends, experience the campus, distributional impacts)
* Equity impacts on students, staff, and faculty
* Impact on residential operations 
* Impact on FSILGs (fewer students will live in FSILG housing, and FSILG leaders and alumni are working with MIT to consider how housing in FSILGs will work in the various options being considered for the upcoming academic year)  
 

**Implementation**

* Ease of public health protocol implementation
* Ease of curricular implementation
* Ease of implementation behaviorally
* Preparedness for a ramp-up (e.g., in the event of a vaccine)
* Preparedness for rapid wind-down (e.g., in the event of a second wave of cases)
* Confidence in planning estimates
* Impacts on faculty/staff (e.g. workload, different working hours)  
 

**Broader Institute Impacts**

* Financial sustainability 
* Reputational impacts 
* Longer-term impacts (e.g., deferrals)
* Cambridge/Boston community economic impact",mit,MIT thinking about next year,40.0,0.99

Essentially this means that if you are an international student who is currently in the US, you have to stay in the US until you graduate (up to ""holidays"") or MIT won't pay you.

What I have been able to find out about this policy change so far:

\-This policy was quite likely forced on MIT by US immigration (vote!).

\-Students who want to return home in spite of this should be able to if they take a leave of absence for a semester, the issue is with paying students rather than the state of an F-1 or J-1 visa.

If anyone knows anything more on this, please leave a comment. If they can find anywhere on the MIT website where this change has been announced that would also be appreciated!

I know MIT is generally a really collaborative environment, but there's a stereotype of finance majors elsewhere being snaky, competitive, or too focused on networking to make real connections. Do you find this to be true at MIT?

I've seen jokes made about people at Sloan and am wondering whether that's just a joke or whether there's actually some real resentment between Sloanies and not-Sloanies. If so, do you feel that it's justified?

Do you find that the relative smartness of people here and the difficulty of the courses make it harder to find career opportunities?

Please add your own suggestions! This list is not comprehensive or complete. It is just restaurants I have gone to and remembered atm.

&amp;#x200B;

* Cambridge Based
   * Five Spice | $$
      * Best and closest mala xian guo place near MIT. The food there is great and the price is very affordable. My go-to place for a long lunch during the day due to its proximity.
   * Mysterious White Food Truck Area 4 | $ - $$
      * It's shady but it's good. I don't know how they make it so good but the food truck parks right in front of Area 4 most days and there is always a line. It is a fast, cheap, delicious way to keep your stomach full especially if you have a tight schedule.
   * L'Verdes | $
      * Will fill you up. Will also take away your soul. Atleast if you get 10 subs they give you a free one.
   * Anna's Tacqueria | $ - $$
      * Is food. Will fill up stomach. Tastes decent I guess. Not a big fan of this kinda of food myself. Alot of people get it nevertheless. Good if you don't have time for anything else.
   * Thelonious Monkfish | $$ - $$$
      * Very expensive. It has sushi boats, fish dons and etc. Good place to bring your date. Wouldn't really go casually tho.
   * HMart Go Go Curry | $$
      * Amazing curry. It is fast, tastes good, and is in HMART so you'll be able to pick up snacks along the way.
   * HMart Sakura Ramen | $$
      * Same thing as Harambe curry. Closest ramen place to campus
   * Dumpling Daughters | $$
      * Pretty good asian food. I appreciate how clean it is and how efficient they make your food.  I like the food but it does not remind me of the stuff I normally eat, esp since alot of the stuff is premade.
   * Chipotle | $ - $$
   * Area 4 | $$
      * Good pizza place(heard from others). It is very close to campus. Never been there myself though.
   * The Smokeshop | $$
      * I really like their smoked meats and their sauce. The price is a little bit on the higher side but it definitely a change of taste compared to the other restaurants named here. I personally think it is worth it.
   * The Friendly Toast | $ - $$
      * A really friendly breakfast diner that makes amazing comfort food. 
   * Roxy's | $$
      * A close-by grilled cheese joint with great tots. I would personally think it is a lil overpriced esp the tomato soup but the taste definitely makes up for it.
   * Oath's | $$
      * Make your own pizza. Never enjoyed it but it is a good eat once in a while.
   * Saloniki's | $ - $$
      * Amazing pitas at this greek restaurant. It is probably as close to campus as you can get. The food is cheap and amazing. Students get free fries if shown ID.
   * Taco Bell  | $
      * \+1 rep for taste, -1 rep for diarrhea
   * Helmand  | $$ - $$$
      * Kinda expensive Afghan restaurants. Their lamb is amazing and I would definitely suggest trying here.
   * Pepper Sky | $$
      * Amazing Thai food. Although I never went there personally, ever club orders it for events.
   * McDonalds | $ - $$
      * Only for late-night shenanigans
   * Dumpling House | $$
      * Amazing Asian restaurant that is also very cheap. Comparable to 5 spice although I think Dumpling house is a little bit better. The only downside is its really up Mass Ave(closer to Harvard than MIT)
   * 430 Tavern | $$
      * Go here for Boston dine out week. The steak tip lunch is amazing, the meat is perfectly tender and the asparagus is amazingly seasoned.
* Boston Based
   * Santouka  | $$
      * The best ramen you'll find near campus. It is a 20 minute walk over the bridge. The line is very long so prepare for a wait. Do make sure to go in duos or by yourself since larger groups take longer to seat. (There is another one in Harvard that will seat you faster). Go here on a date lol
   * Kaju Tofu | $$
      * Amazing tofu soup place. My go-to place to eat when I'm in Boston. Definitely try this place out. Always get an egg in your soup.
   * Hsin Hsin's | $(lunch menu) - $$
      * Really cheap asian food that will give you diabetes or cancer. It tastes good but eat at your own risk.
   * Chef Chang | ?
      * Apparently the noodles are good? Never been before
   * Love Art Sushi | $$
      * Make your own sushi don place. It also offers hand rolls. I ate it a lot over the summer. The price is pretty affordable even with UROP pay.
   * Pad Thai Cafe | $ - $$
      * One of my favorite pad thai places I been to. I like the Indonesian Fried Rice alot. They give you alot of food compared to what you pay.
   * Wendy's | $ - $$
      * I love Wendy's chili's and baconator. What can I say.
   * Boston Burger Company | $$
      * Amazing burgers! Most of the burgers are very fatty and greasy and is impossible to fit in your mouth but it is soooo good. If you go at 4:20, the 420 burger(literally obesity burger) only costs 4.20.
   * Pour House | ?
      * ??? people I know always want to go so it must be good right???
   * Peach Farm | $$
      * Decent asian food place. Not sure if its worth the price since there are so many others which are better.
   * Dumpling Palace | $ - $$
      * This is the one on Mass Ave. The food is really bad. Go there if you're drunk and need to fill up your stomach
   * Haruka Ramen | $$
      * Outwayed by Santouka. It's not a proper ramen place since it also sells other noodles. Overall the quality is not that good. Source: my mom
   * Gourmet Dumpling House | $$
      * There is usually a long wait. The food is really good here especially the dumplings and xiao long bao. Would suggest going here, maybe on a date
   * Taiwan Cafe | $$
      * Can't actually remember much. It is average asian food. Nothing too particular but nothing too bad.
   * Dumpling Cafe | $$
      * Also average asian food. 
   * Double Chin | $$
      * I've only been here once. The food was okay. I went with my gf and I never thought about going back. If invited I would go back but I wouldn't go out of my own choice. Wasn't too memorable
   * Penang | $$
      * I always liked Penang even at home. I like the shrimp noodles but it is definitely an average restaurant taste wise.
   * Pho Pasteur | $$
      * Argued to be the best pho place in Boston. greatly debated
   * Pho Basil | $$
      * On Mass Ave. Another Pho place but this one is closer to campus. The food is good, especially if you want Viet food. The distance to campus is a plus but the taste is a bit lower than Pho Pasteur.
   * Hei La Moon | $$
      * Great dim sum place. Go here with a group and you'll have fun.
   * Tora Japanese Restaurant | $$
      * Amazing sushi/fish don. I discovered this by accident and it is a kinda small and in the ground. But don't be deceived. It is very clean inside and the taste is A1.
   * Quic Pic BBQ | $ - $$
      * I came here when I was hungry late at night after a haircut and the food is decent. It has cha sao(bbq pork). I liked it and am willing to go back again.
   * 5 Spices House | $$
      * Have you ever play Angry Bird's lite? Well 5 spice in Cambridge is angry birds and this 5 spice is pretty much the same thing but as that 5 spice. I would go to the other one though.
   * Ruckus | $$
      * Surprisingly a ramen place. The price is a lil high for what you get. I don't plan on going there again. The taste was not WOW! enough for me to remember too much.
* Allston Based
   * Bonchon | $$
      * Best fried chicken in Boston. Definitely go here once in your life
   * Dumpling Kingdom | $ - $$
      * Very average asian restaurant. Probably shouldn't go since there are wayyy better options
   * Kaju Tofu | $$
      * See above Kaju. Same thing, small differences in menu
   * Seoul Soulongtang | $$
      * Beef bone soup. Good to warming up on a cold day but I do feel like it is a bit bland.
   * Tasty Pot | $$
      * Amazing food. I really like this place and I try to come as much as I can. It is basically hot pot that they precook and most of it is spicy. 
   * Coreanos $ - $$
      * Korean/Mexican fusion. It is a very interesting taste but pretty good nevertheless
   * Le's Vietnamese Cuisine | $$
      * Taste isn't much better than the other Pho restaurants. It is too far to be noted.
   * Gyu Kaku | $$ - $$$
      * Best thing about this place is the unlimited KBBQ. Eat as much as you can! There is alot of meat and the taste is amazing! If you like meat definitely go here.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus Round(Bubble TeaPlaces)

* Kung Fu Tea
   * Down Mass Ave near Symphony,If you join ASA you get a discount
* Gong Cha
   * In chinatown, my favorite place in Boston
    * Update: there is also one in Cambridge Galleria
* Update: Abide
   * More expensive, unique flavored, kinda hipstery bubble tea store next to Darwins. 
* Chatime
   * It is good only if Gong Cha is closed since Gong Cha is just accross the street
* Teado
   * Cheap bubble tea, most clubs order from here for fundraisers
* Royal Tea
   * I think the price is a little bit higher than others. The taste is definitely unique. 

Also check out the bakeries in Chinatown! They are amazing, I love raisin bread and egg tart. Also Kalai has haircuts for $13 dollars. They do a great job at cutting hair although there always is a wait.

1587817626.0,0.0,1.0,"So  I already made a post about this before, but felt like I needed the  input of others before I make a decision. I was admitted to Columbia,  Princeton, Yale, and MIT, and I am intending to study computer science  and economics. While this post is mainly meant for Yale and MIT, I am  still considering the others if you think one of them fits me more.

I'm  aware that these are both incredible institutions, so if you guys know  these universities, I would love it if you advised me mainly based on  fit, and the perceived culture on campus.

Here are a few things about me:

\-  I'm pretty academically well-rounded. I like math and science, but I  also LOVE the humanities. I enjoy writing essays where there is no wrong  answer as long as it's backed up.

\- My fascination with technology mainly comes from the things you can do with it (i.e. application)

\-  I feel that my main strengths are in speech and debate (did a lot of  MUN in HS). I am pretty politically engaged, and I would love to be in a  campus that is similar.

\-I am not  sure that computer science is my life's passion with ultimate  certainty, and later down the road I would much rather have an  executive/leadership role in a company than be a software engineer

\-  I am also a big fan of entrepreneurship, business, and economics, and  would love to take these as either a joint or secondary major. I am  interested in startups and would love to start one in college.

\-I am interested in a more collaborative atmosphere, rather than one that has toxic competition

\-I  am an extrovert- my favorite activities to do on a weekend are social. I  typically go out to town or party, but I am also interested in doing  similar social things on campus.

\-I  would personally prefer an urban environment like that of MIT or  Columbia rather than a suburban/smaller urban one like Yale or Princeton

\-  I'm also scared that the academic rigor of an institution like MIT will  make me hate my major more than an institution like Yale, especially  since I see myself much more as a founder/CEO with a tech background,  rather than a software engineer.

Everyone around me says I'm completely crazy for choosing UD, but I think I have my reasons, I just don't know how valid they are. Before getting into the details, I'll say money is not an issue, I have not been on either campus and I did not actually participate in CP\* at all (kind of regret it but I truly thought MIT wasn't right for me then).

So far I kind of have these arguments for MIT as my parents/friends/current students/third aunt idk tell me: 

* interesting people, will motivate me much more than those even in UD honors
* workload made easier by ""shared suffering"" and collaboration (my high school was kind of like this as a STEM boarding school so I can kind of understand how this can be good)
* resources, connections, prestige (yes everyone mentions this when they talk about me not choosing MIT I don't know how much this really matters, probably more than I think ?)

My gripes about MIT that prevented me from considering it much: 

* WORK - I was a complete nerd last yr in 11th grade and studied for an olympiad possibly avg 5 hrs/day. It was fulfilling in the end but I realized it's definitely not how I want to live life. I couldn't do any hobbies, meet new people, gym, meditate/read for fun/try new things/be happier/etc, and so this year I stopped doing as much schoolwork (took only blowoff classes). I care about chemistry a lot still, it's just I don't want to be stuck studying all the time when (and this is how I perceive it) I could be at UD doing the same thing while actually becoming a better person. I really value my free time now and I think MIT would just kill it so fast
* I have a pipe dream of becoming a high school chemistry teacher (if I ever become extremely patient/talkative/understanding with time) and MIT's prestige doesn't mean anything here (?)
* Also may have a little impostor syndrome lmao but I don't think this is really big

I guess I realized that if I can get in a relaxed schedule, MIT is fine, but I think people have deluded me into thinking ""your life is so easy if you take the bare minimum, everyone at MIT overloads themselves!"" So my questions are

1. For a single-major ChemE, how possible is an average schedule of 8-9 hrs sleep/day, 1-2 hrs hw, 2 hrs non-academic hobby, 1 hr reading for fun, 1 hr gym? I might be completely crazy - is this possible at UD or similar?

I’m currently a sophomore in high school in Florida, and lately I’ve been in the mood of thinking about college and all that stuff.

Obviously it’s not easy to get in, which is what has me worried. I am so far a straight A student and I have already scored a 1550 on the SAT (800 math, 750 EBRW) so I’m not worried there, but after looking at the portfolios of a lot of people who have been recently admitted I feel like I’m not unique enough. Everyone I see keeps saying to focus on one area and be really good at it. So far for me that area is music; I was the pianist in the all state band this year and I’ve received several superior ratings from adjudicators in multiple organizations. But I am also an Eagle Scout and have experience doing things in multiple areas. I feel like I’m almost too well rounded. But I see portfolios of people who are less academically qualified than I am but they get in on the merit that they did something super unique, and I guess I’m just feeling really inadequate and worried that even with another year and a half I won’t be able to make it.

\-------------------

Hi, I'm a '24 choosing between the two schools in title. I am a super indecisive person and literally (literally!) have no idea which one I prefer. Thoughts?

If it helps -- I'm going in as a pure math major and likely pre-MD/PhD. If I go to Brown, I would likely double major in bio/math. I thrive on challenge and being with people who do, but I'm trying to balance that w/ pre-med requirements.

I'm quite social/extroverted and enjoy parties now and then, but I don't plan to drink much (and hope to be at a school where that's okay). I'm a pretty driven/focused person, and I like to be around people who are similar in that way (but collaborative more than competitive). I think ""social nerd"" describes me pretty well, though I'm not super nerdy.

MIT -- **Pros:** What drew me here is the fact that everyone is super driven and wants to make a difference, and research is great. I've made a bunch of friends already and feel like I would fit in very well with the community. I love the idea of having pset parties late into the night on whiteboards and talking about random cool math problems, even if they aren't related to class. **Cons:** I'm worried about the workload, sleep, and mental health, especially since I won't be able to place out of any classes there (my school is not very academic and doesn't offer APs). I also don't know how much time I'd have for extracurriculars.

Brown -- **Pros:** I love the open curriculum. There isn't grade deflation so pre-med might be easier. It also seems like it would be less stressful than MIT, and I could test into higher-level courses. The people seem quite humble and very friendly. **Cons:** I'm worried that I might not find ""my people"" in the same way/the community might not be as good of a fit. At my current HS, I've sometimes felt like it was hard to connect with classmates bc they had very different interests than me. I'm pretty clear this wouldn't be an issue at MIT, not convinced about Brown. I also don't know how strong the pure math program is/what research is like.

To the members of the MIT community,

The day before I was set to graduate from my Caracas high school, the city suffered a major earthquake. Buildings collapsed. There were serious casualties. Suddenly, it was impossible, physically and emotionally, to hold the traditional graduation ceremony we had all been counting on. 

I still remember the pain and disappointment – so I write with special sympathy and great regret to let you know that, in a world so disrupted by Covid-19, it is clear we cannot conduct our traditional in-person celebration of Commencement, Hooding and Tech Reunions in late May. 

To the Class of 2020 and all of our graduating students, to your proud families and faculty friends, and to our reunion-year alumni: I know you have been holding out hope that the recognition you have earned might still be presented in the usual way. We have all been hoping. So I expect this news may be sharply disappointing.

But I promise you, we are going to reinvent these wonderful rituals to honor and celebrate with you, in the best MIT spirit, in ways that make sense in this most unusual time.

Getting the details right will be important, and we know you will have questions; as plans develop, we will share updated information with everyone affected. (And if you already ordered regalia, you will receive a follow-up communication.) 

For now, here are the broad strokes:

To honor the incredible hard work and accomplishments of our graduating students, Commencement 2020 will occur in two parts: 

An online event on May 29 to confer degrees and to celebrate our graduates. Those who plan our usual Commencement will co-design this program with our elected student leaders and some faculty.
An in-person celebration, to be held at MIT at some point in the future. The students, faculty and staff on our Commencement Transition Committee – whom we charged to develop the programming for MIT Commencement in 2021 and beyond – will begin imagining the possibilities for this special Class of 2020 event, under the leadership of committee chair Professor Jim Poterba and bolstered by new student leaders. Proposing that graduates travel back to campus naturally raises questions around equity and financial burdens, so we will do our best to plan with these concerns in mind.
To our graduating students: If you have ideas for these events, please share them with us and your elected student leaders at CommencementIdeas@mit.edu.

Although 2020 Tech Reunions will not occur as they usually would, once we understand the larger circumstances more fully, we will explore ways to honor class milestones and bring the community together again. I am especially grateful to the many class leaders whose energetic outreach – over many years, and in distinctive ways in this challenging time – continues to keep classmates connected to each other and to the great global family of MIT.

If you were planning to attend Reunions, the MIT Alumni Association will be in touch soon to help you navigate these changes.

*   *   *

As the Covid-19 crisis unfolds, you will continue to hear from us – a lot. We are trying to learn what works best in terms of frequency and channels, and we hope to find the right path between “too much” and “not enough.” We will convey practical updates, and we will honor the human stories.

For now, I will simply say that what I most remember from that long-ago earthquake is the people around me – family, neighbors, teachers, friends – shaken to the core, but pulling together to help, with remarkable generosity, fortitude and kindness. 

Those memories echo exactly what I have seen at MIT through the upheaval of these past weeks: students, staff, postdocs and faculty adjusting rapidly to this disconcerting new reality and doing everything they can to help each other and contribute to the greater public good.

In this difficult situation, the people of MIT have already endured and accomplished a great deal. The weeks and months ahead may hold harder challenges. From what I have seen, I have every expectation that our community will meet those new challenges with the same patience, courage, selflessness and grace.

May you all stay safe and well.

Hi!  
I'm a rising sophomore who is still lost as heck when it comes to choosing a major.

- I don't really know what field or subjects interest me, beside the vague notion that I've found that I enjoyed the math, cs, and econ classes I've taken (6.08, 6.042, 18.01/2/3, 14.01).
- I don't have any practical knowledge of what jobs I would get after undergrad. My super idealistic dream would be to work in econ/policy research because from afar or from a completely naive standpoint I think I would enjoy it. But also, financial stability would not be a thing I would turn down. 
- I'm interested in 6/18 because of the problem-solvingy aspect of like 'solve so-and-so problem given certain constraints and tools'. I became interested in 14 after taking 14.01, and I'm interested in 15-1 because management seems to involve the skills I lack the most and thus should work on.",mit,Subject recommendations in choosing major?,6.0,0.8

A call for help: 

Has anyone considered using a raspberry pi or other microcontroller to hack something like a CPAP machine or other pressurized air device (like SCUBA gear) to make a DIY ventilator? This could save a lot of lives. Our current supply is in the thousands, not enough by far. 

As a healthcare provider, the settings we adjust are: inspiration/expiration pressure, volume of air delivered, and ratio of inhale/exhale times. Some people require oxygen to be added. 
Patients who are incubated are sedated so they generally have no respiratory drive at all. 

BTW: CPAP is continuous positive airway pressure, which helps those who stop breathing during sleep and they have adjustments for pressure only. 

Please share this with other maker communities as we need to think outside the box.

First, we are cancelling all classes tomorrow, Friday, March 13. This decision was made after consultation with Academic Council, the faculty officers, and MIT Medical.

We are also strongly advising all undergraduate students to accelerate their move out plans. MIT will reimburse travel change expenses and new reservation costs up to $500 for undergraduates who move up their departure to before Sunday, March 15 at midnight. Additional resources for an accelerated move out, including free pick up and storage of belongings, can be found here.

I figured out the housing situation that I posted about last week (thank you guys for the advice). Now that I’m registered, I want to change the grading for one of my classes to pnr but the deadline was yesterday. (I got approved by the course instructor to change the grading yesterday, I just forgot to submit the changes to the registrar.) Now I have to submit a late change form (see picture). I don’t really know how I’m supposed to answer the questions (or rather, how they want me to answer the questions), especially the last one.

I suppose with the first one, I can just explain that I wasn’t able to register until very late, but “why should you be allowed to change the status of this subject after the deadline” is a question that I have no clue how to answer. I don’t really know how they want me to answer it—should I explain that I don’t feel I’ll get the grade I want or what? I’m not really sure how to convince them that I should be allowed to. Or am I just being overly worried and it’s likely they won’t care what I write there?

MIT housing just sent out an email saying unregistered students have to vacate housing by Feb. 28 (friday). This is the only notice they’ve sent (to me, at least).

So I’m confused by this email—it says to go the registrar if you’re planning on being a fully registered student. Which I am, but the reason I’m not currently registered is due to a financial registration hold (which  my family and I have been trying to get cleared, but in the meantime I’ve been receiving grades for assignments/exams for 3 classes/36 units).

Would going to the registrar even help my case? I feel like the only thing that could help is going to SFS (since they placed the hold on my account), but SFS has not been helpful whatsoever in the past, so I don’t really think they’d be able to assist me.

I’m planning on setting up an appointment with housing services, but I’m afraid that won’t help either. I don’t know if I’ll be able to meet with them by the 28th and I don’t know if they’ll force me to leave even if I can’t meet with them by them. I don’t really know where i’m going to go on such short notice. I wish MIT would have sent this email out earlier—I’m not saying it’s not my fault for having a hold, but the deadline to remove myself and my belongings is in two days.

I guess I’m just looking for advice? I admit I don’t know how to navigate this situation, and I really don’t know what to if I do get kicked out of housing. If I do get kicked out, I would still want to attend classes (so that I can have grades for when I ultimately get the hold cleared), but that would likely mean being homeless.",mit,housing/registration hold help,16.0,0.95

Over the past year and a half I have been reading a lot about retiring early on the /r/fire subreddit and reading about real estate and stock investing. My goal is to retire by 32/33 (i.e. 10 years after I graduate), which, based off my research, is entirely possible with the typical engineering salaries and aggressive savings.

However, most of my friends in my friend group at MIT can't really comprehend why anyone would want to retire so early. Some even sort of judge me for it and lowkey call me lazy or selfish. I, on the other hand, can't really see why anyone *wouldn't* want to retire early. So we are in an impasse.

I sort of suspect it's just the nature of the type of people who apply and get accepted to MIT.  Most of my friends seem to really love what they do and want to help the world. Unfortunately, I never really found anything that has inspired me, or at least not enough to make me want to work 9-5+ for the next 40 years of my life. I feel sort of bad for not having found my ""passion"", but I also sort of feel like more people at any other school would understand me, and it's just a function of the fact that I'm at MIT that my friends look at me strangely when I tell them of my early retirement goals.

When I was in the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program, they urged us to read the essay [A Message to Garcia](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/hubbard1899.pdf). The essay is mostly a late-1890s polemic against workers who would take a task and then spend their day at the pub. But the key takeaway for a younger me was:

&gt; You, reader, put this matter to a test: You are sitting now in your office—six clerks are within your call. Summon any one and make this request: “Please look in the encyclopedia and make a brief memorandum for me concerning the life of Corregio.”

&gt; Will the clerk quietly say, “Yes, sir,” and go do the task?

&gt; On your life, he will not. He will look at you out of a fishy eye, and ask one or more of the following questions:

&gt; 1) Who was he?

&gt; 2) Which encyclopedia?

&gt; 3) Where is the encyclopedia?

&gt; 4) Was I hired for that?

&gt; 5) Don’t you mean Bismarck?

&gt; 6) What’s the matter with Charlie doing it?

&gt; 7) Is he dead?

&gt; 8) Is there any hurry?

&gt; 9) Shan’t I bring you the book and let you look it up yourself? 

&gt; 10) What do you want to know for?

&gt; And I will lay you ten to one that after you have answered the questions, and explained how to find the information, and why you want it, the clerk will go off and get one of the other clerks to help him find Garcia.

At the time, I took this to heart alongside “Impossible is Nothing” and “Sleep is for the Weak”.

So when my first job asked me to write an API integration with UnionPay, what did I do about the fact that the API docs were in Chinese and so were the error messages? Did I raise a red flag about the schedule risk and get the docs professionally translated so my team could deliver the project and it's additional revenue? No, I stayed up late in the office with Google Translate. The project never shipped.

I was fired for poor performance before the year’s end.



My lessons:

 * Your role as an engineer is to isn’t to search through jungle and sugarcane alone. Your job is to muster the resources you need to see the job done. So yes, ask the other clerk.

 * Learn to [Ask Good Questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) which empower your colleagues to successfully help you.

 * Understand the “Why” behind a task, so you can exercise skilled judgment about what trade-offs to make. If writing a memo, know your audience, why they need to read it, and what you can omit from the source material.

 * Understand the urgency and impact of a task so you know what sort of resources are appropriate to spend. That includes allocating your own attention. (See also: the Eisenhower Matrix)

 * Proactively clear up misunderstandings. If you were just discussing German politics, don’t write a memo on Italian renaissance painters because you blindly followed a non-sequetur request. 

 * Know your team’s strengths and weaknesses. If a colleague Charlie would be stronger at writing about Italian art, then be clear on whether or not you should pitch-hit for him or have him review your work.

 * Get good food, exercise, and sleep because [your brain is made of meat](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html)

Now I read at the beginning of the book used in 18.700 (the book is Linear algebra done right, Sheldon Axler) something like ""this should be the second course you take on linear algebra"", so I guess it assumes previous knowledge.

So is it better to take 18.06 and then 18.700, or just skip 18.06. I would thank anyone who has taken these courses to help me on this. Thanks in advance!

Hello. I am 18 year old high school student with very good grades and big ambitions from Serbia. I'm interasted in chemical engeneering and have been working as an undergraduate researcher on Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy, University in Belgrade; department of organic chemisty (despite being in high school) for past 2 and a half years. Now where's the catch? Generally speaking, price to monthly income ratio in Serbia is quite off and working conditions are quite bad (I won't be bothering you about living conditions in Serbia but it can be Googled easly how bad the situation is). Not a lot of funding goes to science which makes any long term research nearly impossible. We are using long expired chemicals, some of them are over 50 or 60 years old, malfunctioned instruments etc. I was okay with all of this until recently, our storage fridge caught fire and all my progress got lost in flames. I got nothing now. It is important to mention that our 'chemical storage fridge' was just a plain household fridge.  I talked with few colleagues and they suggested me to inquire about MIT. I've sent many e-mails to MIT staff but so far got only auto-replies. So i found this subreddit and now im curious what i need to be qualified to apply for MIT. It is also important to notice that average salary here is around 300USD. I'm not in the average range but still I'm not even close to afford college in US, so I'm wondering if there are any scholarships that could cover university expenses. I would like to get feedback from both staff and students if possible.

Thanks kind reader for helping me out!

TL;DR I'm a highschool student who is interasted in chemical engeneering. I'm a fulltime undergraduate researcher but due to lack of fund investment in Science in Serbia and general lack of interest for science I'm seeking for MIT. Monthly income is many times lower that of average US salary so I won't be able to afford to attend MIT unless i get some form of scholarship.
