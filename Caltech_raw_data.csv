I was admitted to Caltech EA back in December and I have a few open-ended questions.

What advice would you give to an incoming Caltech frosh that you wish you had coming into Caltech? Also, I'm interested in majoring in either mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, or computer science. Any insights regarding these majors? Lastly, how's the work-life balance at Caltech?

Specifically, I’m curious about things like premarital sex, alcohol and drugs and profanity. (Especially the first one).

For context, CalTech was always my dream school, although I couldn’t even apply for undergraduate due to various circumstances. I’ll relatively soon be graduating and am considering CalTech for my Masters/PhD. However, especially with recent events, I’ve realized how much I dislike being alone.

It might be my last chance to make friends and try dating and looking for a potential life partner. So, I’m curious what the culture is on campus and how many other people have similar values.

To clarify, I’m not ultraconservative or anything. I don’t mind if you do drugs, drink alcohol, or cuss every other word. I won’t hold it against you, you’ll still likely be a friend, I just won’t do so myself. (This would however be a turn off for a potential spouse).
My greatest concern is that I would potentially try dating someone and enter into the relationship with different expectations, potentially breaking someone’s heart, and/or my own.

* We do not believe that those protocols have direct implications for graduate students who live in apartment settings and engage in laboratory research regulated by other workplace protocols.
* In light of the ongoing public health risks to our community, we discourage undergraduate students from moving to Pasadena in order to live near campus.
* The Undergraduate Deans' Office and Office of Residential Experience will establish virtual living/learning groups for first-year students, with regular interactions and engagements with an assigned faculty advisor and undergraduate peer and graduate mentors.

Hybrid on-campus / online model: 

&gt;""A pre-approved list of courses that require in-person activity will be  offered on campus, with all other courses being conducted remotely.""

On-campus residency:

&gt;Rooms in all on-campus undergraduate residences will be limited to  single occupancy. This will reduce student density in the residences and  will maintain an appropriate student-to-restroom ratio. For fall term,  and perhaps for the remainder of the 2020-2021 academic year, Avery and  the South Houses will be reserved as quarantine and isolation spaces for  residential students in the event a student falls ill or becomes  symptomatic.

Who gets to be on-campus: 

&gt;To support the limited re-occupation of on-campus residences, we  expect to invite undergraduate students to campus in the stages that  follow. It is important to emphasize that changes in public health  conditions and government directives at any time may restrict our  ability to accommodate all groups of students.  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Continuing students whose essential academic progress this year requires enrollment in courses with in-person components.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. International students whose presence on campus is required for maintenance of immigration status.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Students  who demonstrate that their personal, financial, or academic situation  requires special consideration for on-campus housing.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. First-year  and new transfer students, along with some upper-class student advisors  to support the residential experience of other students.  
&gt;  
&gt;Depending on availability of space, continuing students who may have a  nonacademic reason to be on campus, such as student athletes, also may  have an opportunity to return to campus.

House system:

&gt;While we understand that house affiliation in an important part of  the residential experience for many undergraduate students, the current  limits on occupancy and requirements for maintaining quarantine and  isolation space will not allow us to offer rooms in all of the houses.  For this reason, we will be making spaces available in the undergraduate  residences in the fall term, but we will not be reopening the houses.  House communities and the house experience will remain virtual for the  fall term and likely for the coming academic year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Similarly, the  restrictions on social gatherings and activities prohibit Caltech from  being able to allow for Rotation, a valued Caltech tradition that helps  welcome new students to campus and inaugurate the academic year.  Rotation activities are intensively and extensively social in ways that  are risky and inappropriate given COVID-19 conditions. For these  reasons, Fall term rotation has been cancelled, and the assignment of  incoming students to house communities will be discussed with student  leadership during the fall term.

I've found one other person that will be here until December and we also found an apartment at 211 S Wilson that we are interested in moving to where the rent will be $800 per person (with utilities included) and a $666.66 security deposit per person. Alternatively, if we stay at my current dwelling both of the rooms are around $833-$900 per month - not sure exactly as the rent hasn't been split evenly. The current place is at 987 E Del Mar. Both apartments are 2 bedrooms and 2 baths with hardwood floors, AC, a laundry facility or in unit (respectively), 2 parking spots, normal kitchen amenities, etc. The Wilson one might be nicer though as the current place has been lived in by many generations of students. Also, utilities are not included in the rent at the Del Mar apt. We also have the living room fashioned into my bedroom and both bathrooms are in the actual bedrooms which has not been a large issue over the years but is part of the reason we are looking to move (so I don't wake anyone at night). The apartment on Wilson is described as ""mostly furnished"" which translates into having a bed ready for you and a small looking desk+chair in the living room that id be happy to give up. Both are essentially a 3ish minute walk to campus if not for the pesky traffic light! The Del Mar apartment is also furnished for obvious reasons - but you may have to pay my current roomates for the furniture. 

All manner of people are welcome, including grad students and visiting researchers, etc. We're looking for one person for a year long lease starting in September and another person to switch out after/around new years (so January-end of August 2021).

0.0,1586791274.0,14.0,caltech,"Sorry to fill the sub with another one of these posts. Currently I'm leaning towards Caltech over CMU, but I have a few nagging concenrs I'd like to get y'all's opinion on. Obviously, I’m unable to visit either school before I have to make the choice.

Quick background on me (skip to the numbered part if you don’t care): My primary interest is in Robotics, I’d likely take additional classes in EE/ME/Robotics/CDS regardless of where I go. On CS, I’d say I’m slightly more practically oriented than theoretical (in subject area, not looking for an SWE degree), but that doesn’t mean I’m not excited about PLT/Category theory, cryptography, or the mathematics of distributed systems.

From what I’ve been able to find so far, Caltech offers challenging CS courses, if admittedly challenging in a different way than CMU. I’m not the biggest fan of the core requirements and lack of AP/college credit; some quick math showed that ***40% of all credits at Caltech will be spent taking core requirements***, (assuming 5 classes for 12 quarters averaging 9.7 credits each) compared to 23% at CMU. I’d be curious to hear more about the value of that.

My main concern is about the depth/breadth of CS classes and the variety/availability of research positions in CS/Robotics.

1. Did/does the core requirements get in the way of other classes you wanted to take? Do you plan on doing anything with the things learned in core classes? CS Alumni: Do you wish you had taken more CS or more other stuff?
2. Have you ever felt that a CS course lacked depth/breadth? How theoretical vs. practical are the curriculum offerings? Alumni: did you feel prepared for industry work, and what do you do?
   1. My concern stems from [posts like this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-Caltech/answer/Jessica-Su) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sn9lg/where_should_i_go_for_undergrad_cs_berkeley_or/c4ffi82/). Quote: ""Now that I've spent some time at Stanford, I think my Caltech experience was limiting.  There were entire fields of CS that I hadn't heard of before coming to Stanford (like programming languages and HCI).  Also we didn't have a lot of systems classes, so when I got to Stanford I had to take a lot of breadth requirements that most students placed out of.""
   2. Looking at the course catalog, most bases seem to be covered. From the best I can tell, notable omissions include compilers/optimization, possibly reinforcement learning, and several courses not offered this year, without any information about their return.
3. I know there are ample research opportunities at Caltech, and that they are fairly easy to get. My concern is the availability of positions in things I’m interested in that involve meaningful work. This stems from the small size of the CS department, combined with anecdotes like [this one](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-Caltech/answer/Martin-Michelsen): “It seemed to me that there were plenty of opportunities for research, but not many of them were pure CS; most opportunities were collaborations with other departments.” How much choice is there in research opportunities?
4. How common is it to take graduate courses?
5. (for alumni) Has core actually helped you in your career? What have you used it for? Has the Caltech “network” helped you at all?

**TL;DR:** 1. How much does core interfere with work in your major? 2. Does the smaller offering in CS courses reflect lack of depth in topics? 3. How much choice is there in research opportunities?",Help ease my concerns choosing Caltech over CMU for CS,t3_g0kz2v,14.0,0.95,csdecider

I am an EU student, thinking of studying EE, currently leaning towards Caltech quite a bit!

**Caltech**:

Pros:

* More financial aid, so would be cheaper (nearly no debt after graduation)
* Many undergraduate research opportunities at places like NASA JPL, LIGO
* Unconditional offer
* Weather is much nicer
* Much smaller (could also be a con)
* Professors are very approachable
* Ability to take a minor in another subject

Cons:

* Very far away from home
* Located in suburbs, not a very ""student city"" feeling (I have not been on campus, though)
* Not such a diverse atmosphere (few international students, generally STEM majors)
* Not such a wide range of clubs

**Cambridge**:

Pros:

* Much closer to home (geographically and culturally)
* 4 years for a masters degree
* Very diverse atmosphere (a lot of international students, STEM among humanities, etc. majors)
* Cambridge is an amazing city
* Wide range of clubs
* Supervisions

Cons:

* Conditional offer (won't know if I got admitted for 100% until August)
* More expensive
* Not as much freedom in choosing what classes to take/switching majors, taking a minor
* Not as many opportunities for undergraduate research

If I go to UW I could probably finish a year early since they accept AP credit and Caltech doesn't. I was wondering which school is better for computer science.

Edit:

Adding onto my question here's a little more insight as to what I'm looking for in my CS education (this is just a copy of the response I gave to hypercube42342 when they asked me what I was exactly looking for):

""My definition of better is more like at which school would I get deeper CS knowledge and experiences. Additionally, my goals are definitely to go into the corporate world after my undergrad and I am not interested in higher education like a Ph.D. So I guess the main traits that would be good for me are developing a strong CS foundation, being able to learn cutting-edge topics in CS like machine learning and quantum computing, definitely getting enough practical experience (I'm concerned by the focus on theory at Caltech), and lastly I'm also looking for getting good CS internship opportunities during the summer as well as research throughout the year.

My main concern in comparing UW to Caltech was that UW CS is ranked higher for CS than Caltech and that the UW CS department is getting a lot of funding.""

Our problem is specifically how to minimize risk for viral transmission during airway management. Intubation is amongst the highest risk procedure for these patients, yet is necessary in critical patients. A Taiwanese anesthesiologist came up with a design for a simple cheap box for cleanable particle limiation. Please see the following for a basic schematic: https://sites.google.com/view/aerosolbox/design

I think it could be done better, and if engineered to be produced at scale could save a lot of healthcare workers. Please let me know if anyone on this subreddit would be interested in helping.

Thank you.
Brian Hondorp, MD

Edit:
Wow! Thank you everyone for responding, I wasn’t sure I’d get any responses.

Here are where I see the current limitations with this design:

1) Arm range of motion. Some patients, particularly those with “difficult airways” require more manipulation of the head in order to achieve a sufficient laryngoscopic view for intubation. A modification that allows for greater range of arm motion, particularly in the vertical dimension, while maintaining minimal aerosol exposure would be great. Specifically, the arm motion that would be limited by this box is head and neck manipulation to allow placing the patient in the “sniffing” position.

2) The top seam on the working side is in the direct line of sight. While not a deal breaker, it would be preferable to have ability to see through a clear panel that is perpendicular to line of sight, rather than potentially needing to look through a seam. Perhaps an angled panel would help? 

3) The bottom of the box is entirely open. It is necessary to have space to accommodate a variety of chest circumferences, as well as having space for an assistant to hand the Endotracheal tube, circuit, etc.  However, this potentially exposes assistants or other staff standing nearer to the foot of the bed to higher viral loads. I think an ideal solution would seal the bottom without being rigid. A surgical gown (or even a blanket) could be draped over the bottom for this purpose, but increases disposable costs and setup time. Is there a simple way to avoid this while providing better isolation for the bottom of the box than open air?",Physician call for help from engineers,t3_fnzqwv,24.0,1.0,[deleted]

* The Institute has established an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) that is operating in collaboration with the infectious disease group in planning for and implementing the Institute's preparedness efforts. Through this operation, the Institute is in regular communication with the Pasadena Public Health Department (PPHD).
* The instructional term ended Wednesday, March 11. Undergraduate students will complete their final exams and assignments for the quarter remotely and have been strongly encouraged to return home for the duration of spring break.
* A transition to remote learning will begin effective the first day of spring term, Monday, March 30.
* The Institute has offered guidance on non-essential domestic travel and has implemented international travel restrictions.
* Caltech is canceling all campus and off-campus events through June 12, the end of spring quarter, with the possible exception of commencement exercises. We hope that conditions may improve in time to hold our 126th Commencement ceremony, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. on June 12. We will provide updates on plans for commencement as the date approaches.
* All spring intercollegiate athletic contests and practices will be canceled as of March 15. This action is taken in concert with our Division 3 conference, the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) which has canceled all conference competition for the spring.
* Caltech custodial staff have introduced enhanced cleaning measures, which includes using EPA-recommended antimicrobial products on high-traffic surfaces, such as elevator buttons and doorknobs, three times per day
* The Children's Center at Caltech (CCC) will be closed Tuesday March 17 through Friday, March 27. The CCC announcement can be found [here](https://www.caltech.edu/documents/47/CCC_closure_Covid19.pdf).",Latest COVID-19 updates from campus,t3_fjoa12,31.0,1.0,caltechedu

I'm having a difficult time making up my mind, and I had some reservations about Caltech due to the mixed things I read on the internet. :( Could you guys give me some advice, and perhaps answer some questions I had?

1. Mental health? I read on a random thread from a while back that depression was pretty widespread at Caltech. Is this true? Do you guys think that someone with preexisting mental health issues would heavily suffer at Caltech? I'm usually a very bubbly and extroverted type of girl. However, I unfortunately have some issues with cutting. I am genuinely working on improving my mental health, and I am planning to seek help soon, but mental health was one of the reasons I felt unsure about Tech.
2. The rigor? Is the work at Caltech ""do-able"" with hard work? I've read in many places that Caltech is genuinely a humbling experience. Personally, I don't really consider myself the smartest in school. I've met far more people who are smarter in my high school journey. Although I did well in my IB program and had good test scores, I'm much more of the ""hard-working type"" than the ""naturally smart type"" (if that makes sense). I'm more than ready to be humbled by my brilliant peers, but I'm honestly worried: Will a hardworking student who is not the typical ""genius"" type be okay at Tech? Sometimes, it seems like Caltech is a place for geniuses, and I feel quite intimidated.
3. Not having free time? On average, how much sleep does a Caltech student get? How much free time did/do you guys have?
4. Fitting in? At Caltech, would I still be able to find people who are pretty chill and down to earth? I was a little intimidated by how ""nerdy"" some of the kids I met on the accepted student discord were, haha.
5. Social life? Do you still find time to socialize with others? Also, coming from a very small town in the south, I love that Caltech is near LA. Do you have time to explore LA and to go into the city?
6. Do you regret it? Do you regret choosing Caltech?

Commit to Caltech if you enjoy real hard work, if Science and Research brings you pure joy, if you do not need typical college social life.

I'm a recently admitted Prefrosh who's looking to major in either ChemE or BioE. I was wondering if I could receive some advice on which to pick.

My goal is to develop and implement a more effective drug delivery system using nanorobotics; essentially tapping into the work of Dr. Qian and others and applying it to therapeutics. To do this I'd like to do research during the school year every year.

I'm struggling to pick between these majors because there are few cons to each of them from my perspective:

Cons of BioE:
- pays a lot less for just a undergrad degree, which is relevant to me because I need to pay down 80k of student loan debt between undergrad and getting a PhD. A lower paying job means more years between undergrad and PhD.
- Maybe be harder to get a job in the pharmaceutical industry between undergrad and PhD.

Cons of ChemE:
- I have to take a few courses Im not personally interested in.
- the courseload for ChemE is far more extensive, meaning that I'd have to take at least 5 courses every term for every term in my four years. I worry that this will impede my ability to get meaningful research done during the year. 

I know this is a long post so I appreciate any advice! Hopefully someone will correct a misunderstanding I might have in my cons list, or perhaps suggest an optional way forward.

I'm a 3rd year undergrad (just finished second year) on a Maths and Physics course at a university in the UK. I'm currently doing a similar program to SURF at my own uni, with a particle physics professor, so I do have some relevant experience. I finish on the 7th. I've asked if he knows anybody at Caltech but he says he doesn't, but he suggested that one other professor might so I'll email him soon. 

I'm more interested in the theory side of particle physics so would prefer to work in the particle theory group but would be open to the experimental side too.

The particle group at my uni is relatively young but has a good reputation and has it's hands in pretty much all the major experiments going on around the world. My current supervisor is also fairly well known (I think but my only experience is at my own uni so that might bias me a bit) but he and the group are established enough that I think the Caltech professors will be aware of them.

So if anybody has experience applying to SURF from outside the US or even just from a uni outside of Caltech any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also any advice about SURF/the particle professors from someone at Caltech would be good too. I'm particularly interested in how to go about picking a supervisor and since Caltech doesn't provide funding how likely it is the professor will be willing to fund someone they've never met.

I like the idea of having a singles dorm and being able to avoid hazing/pressure in houses. I've also heard some pretty weird stories about some house traditions (throwing food at people or having food thrown at you, pressure to drink, etc.). I also realize that these are only singular cases and the majority of people loved the House system. What I want to know is, what do alum/current students think?

On the one hand, SLO's Learn by Doing methodology and close industry connections will seriously up my odds of finding work right out of college.

Both have small class sizes and close faculty-student relationships, though CalTech obviously wins in that regard.

My GRE was pretty bad too- 316. 

I know it's below Caltech standards.

* Math: calc 1, calc 2, calc 3, linear, differential, and numerical methods
* Chemistry: chem 1, chem 2, orgo 1, orgo 2, [lecture and labs], biochem 1, biochem 2, analytical, physical chemistry,

Upperclassmen will no longer be involved in the sorting of freshmen into Houses, and the freshmen’s preferences will be the sole determining factor in their assignment. The explicit goal is for freshmen to ultimately choose where they will live before they ever arrive on campus.

The verdict was made unilaterally and inserted at the last minute to a housing plan years in the making. The students who were involved in the plan's creation were not notified of the change until late last night. You can read the document for yourself here https://studaff.caltech.edu/documents/71-bechtelplan-2-1-2018_final.pdf (Rotation material starts on page 7.)

The House system is the foundation of undergraduate excellence at Caltech – our honor code, our academic success, and our recruiting efforts depend on it. House communities are also a critical part of the mental health safety net that keeps Techers sane and alive.

A threat to the House system is a threat to the continued existence of Caltech as a first-class undergraduate institution, and an affront to the entire Caltech undergraduate and alumni population.

This is likely the biggest threat the House system has faced since its founding in 1931.

The travel restrictions of the executive order of January 27th have introduced uncertainty and difficulty into the lives of many of the international scholars of our community. In response, a group of concerned faculty is convening an open gathering in support of Caltech's international scholars. All students, postdocs, staff, and faculty are invited. A plan for this event was presented at a recent Institute-wide faculty meeting and was met with overwhelming support.

This gathering will take place next Wednesday, March 1st, at 12:15pm, outside, at the Millikan Pond, which is on the east side of Millikan Library. Members of the Caltech community, including several faculty, will give short speeches. A primary objective of this gathering is to provide the Caltech community with the opportunity to sign a large poster with the statement:

""We, as members of the Caltech community, stand by our international scholars who have been affected by travel restrictions.""

Although the short speeches will conclude at 1pm, the poster will remain available for signing until 2pm. We encourage all who feel strongly about these issues to participate, and to sign our collective statement of support.

(1) What do you like about these designs?

(2) What color schemes do you think would work with any one of these designs? (I don't want to feel confined to orange and white, but I'm partially colorblind so I tend to not fuss over color.)

(3) What design elements are you interested in that are not represented among the 7 designs at the link above? (Feel free to provide links to images that exhibit these design elements, particularly if they are t-shirts are from universities.)

If you too would like to contribute to better Caltech t-shirts, then post in the comments below or message me. Digital media experience (e.g. Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign) is helpful, but so are hand-sketched designs! (Although I can't promise I'll be good enough with Illustrator to faithfully render a sketch).

If you've never designed t-shirts before, here are some guidelines:

(1) Use a small number of solid colors (the cost per unit increases substantially with each new color).

(2) Don't feel constrained to Caltech colors (although if you can think up a cool orange and white shirt, more power to you).

(3) Avoid significantly altering existing Caltech symbols. The more a design deviates from guidelines listed here (https://identity.caltech.edu/standards/visual), the less likely administrators are to approve said design. You can probably deviate from those guidelines a little bit though, insofar as I've seen Caltech administration distribute Caltech gear that violates those style guidelines.

(4) Consider working with a blank t-shirt template (either in a digital media editor or when sketching) to see how the design looks in proportion with the rest of the shirt.

I am coming here for my graduate study. In graduate courses, homework worth like 70~80% of the grade.  However, in many course syllabus, the instructors point out that ""collaboration is encouraged"" when doing these homeworks. If you collaborate, you must indicate the names of person you are working with and also write out the solution independently.  

When I did my Bachelor, I almost always study by myself. ( I think group study is very inefficient because sometimes people are getting off-topic and start chatting about non-homework related stuff).   In addition, there are always be a person or two not contributing positively toward the discussion (they are just there because they want to copy solution off the smart ones).

0.0,1456132380.0,1.0,caltech,"Hi all! I'm a current sophomore.

Although I'm already two years in, I am still grappling with understanding why humanities classes are required at Caltech. About every couple of weeks I tend to oscillate between an edgy teenage voice in my head saying ""the humanities are worthless!"" and a more calming voice of reason saying ""humanities classes help you think critically and process information."" However no matter what I just can't suppress that voice in the back of my mind questioning the usefulness of the humanities courses.

I can see humanities classes being useful if done in a sincere way, but from my experience most humanities courses are not done as sincerely as faculty might hope. For example, just a few minutes ago I heard someone in my hallway exclaiming, ""I have an essay and two problem sets due tomorrow! I'm just going to BS something for the essay and hope I get an A!"" I am occasionally drawn to this type of thinking as well, even if I know how insincere it is.

All this makes me question how useful of an exercise it is to require undergraduates to take 12 humanities courses over 4 years. One response may be that humanities classes help with writing, and eventually yield dividends when it comes to scientific writing. But in that case, why doesn't Caltech have students primarily take scientific writing courses instead, or require an undergraduate research thesis? Why does writing education have to be delivered through a broad range of topics ranging from social sciences to philosophy? Another response may be that humanities classes provide a break from the sciences, but to me it seems like having no humanities requirement would be reduce stress by providing more free time to students.

Whatever Caltech's end goal for us is, why does it have to be executed through 12 humanities courses, four of which are humanities, four of which are social sciences, and four of which are wildcard courses? It seems somewhat arbitrary, and I have trouble seeing if there would be an effective difference in our educational outcomes if no humanities courses were required at all.

But the system for distributing sandwiches was cringe-worthy and anxiety-triggering. Everyone had name tags - for socializing purposes - which they had to take to the sandwich table to get their food. The caterers knew which sandwich to provide each alumnus because their order was printed on their name tag. Now, I'm uncomfortable announcing to the world my sandwich preferences; I feel like this system would have discouraged consumption of exotic sandwiches except I doubt anyone expected to be outed when they signed up. But the worst part was the layout of the name tags: all the text was in the same size and font. From a distance, I figured the name tags read, for example, ""John Doe: Class of '84"" or ""Jane Doe: Software Engineer at Microsoft,"" but as I neared the mass of awkwardly small-talking ex-students I realized to my amusement their identifiers were all of the form ""Mary Smith: Ham Sandwich"" or ""Bill Johnson: Turkey and Cheese."" Just terrible. Had I been part of the event I would have left out of embarrassment once this incompetence was revealed to me but only after snatching up my badge from the registration table as to conceal my secret identity as a ""BLT hold the onions."" And just imagine the icebreakers: not ""BS in Physics? me too!"" but rather ""So how was the roast beef?"" Luckily today I could observe from a safe and private distance. I considered lying my way into free food as I often do, but then I thought of the poor alumnus who would drive across the state in search of nostalgic moments with old buddies only to discover his meticulously planned sandwich missing, the scarlet letter pinned to his chest a constant reminder of his hunger and a testament, in the eyes of his peers, to his deeply held sandwich preferences - the very core of who he had become since graduating.

0.0,1453879944.0,17.0,caltech,"**I’m a Caltech grad student and I’m going to be writing anonymously.**
 
&amp;nbsp;

Over the past few months I’ve found myself typing into Google “I hate Caltech,” trying to find some satisfying anti-Caltech comments to empathize with and help me vent. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I can’t complain about Caltech to my fellow students; if you complain it looks like a sign that you personally are just doing poorly, and so you are mad. 

&amp;nbsp;

But that’s not the case. I’ve done well in classes. I passed my qualifying exam on my first try. My peers know I’m smart. But I am mad, here’s why:

&amp;nbsp;

1\. My first research advisor was unprofessional. He told me repeatedly that I ""didn’t know how to do research."" He told me that I was not working hard. He told me at one point that I didn’t know how to read. When I left his group, he said unprofessional things about me to the other graduate students in the research group. I'm still left wondering if the fact that I am a woman caused him to treat me differently. 

&amp;nbsp;

2\. My department is Really unorganized. Last year my department devised a new set of classes that are required for all new students. Almost ALL the classes I took in my first year were completely NEW classes, and the class organization, the lectures, and the homeworks had definite BUGS. We were unfortunate guinea pigs.  

&amp;nbsp;

3\. The date of the PhD qualifying exam kept being postponed, for over a month. It was the biggest test of the year, but we didn’t know if suddenly they would say, ‘Oh, we scheduled your test for tomorrow.’ If the department doesn't take the students' time seriously, how are we going to take them seriously? This kind of behavior would be unacceptable in an industry or professional setting. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

I could go on, but I don’t want to complain. I want to move on, and focus on my research. But something last week brought it all back. I read the BuzzFeed and NYT articles about two girls who were harassed by a professor. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel lucky that my first advisor wasn’t as bad as that. But he made me feel terrible, and I really did question my worth as a researcher. I felt that maybe some of the things he said to me were at least partly true. And I am a woman, and I really hope that he didn’t treat me differently because of it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve found a new advisor, and things are generally OK. 

&amp;nbsp;

**But, I still feel mad.**

&amp;nbsp;

I feel that Caltech is not giving me what I need as a researcher. The departments are very small, and I don’t have enough people to interact with. I went to a large university for my undergrad, and everyone bounced ideas off of each other. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, sometimes I stand in the main lobby of my building, at 1pm, and no one else is to been seen. Only maybe a secretary, always an older woman, will walk by, and smile at me. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Does anyone else feel the same way?**

1) Is the tap water safe to drink?

2) Where can I get fresh and cheap produce near Catalina Ave, other than Trader Joes?

3) I don't have a data plan for my phone yet, so I'm gonna do this (http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/05/enable-internet-sharing-mac-os-x/). Is this okay? I read some rules about IP sharing and how it's not allowed... I'm not very sure about this sort of stuff. I'm currently using Caltech Guest, but it's kinda weak.

4) Lady at housing desk told me file sharing is strictly forbidden, so I have to quit torrenting I guess. How do you guys get your TV-fix? Netflix? Hulu? Any free sources to share?

5) Since I'm only here for a few months I am looking for a cheap data plan for my phone, and I don't need call or text, just about 0.5-1gb of data a month. So far the quotes I got were around 30 to 40 dollars each month. Do you guys know where and how I can get a cheaper data plan?


Lastly, if anyone is selling pots, pans, and other kitchenware for cheap,  let me know!

I'm an Aero sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic, working on my undergrad with the plan of going straight into Aeronautical or Space Eng in my graduate studies after I finish getting 'tute screwed.

Somehow I missed the memo about Caltech when I was looking for schools -- In my search for a small, top-tier, sociable tech school, I ended up in New England shoveling snow instead of California on the beach. As a southerner from a small town, the more I read, the more I'm falling in love with your school. Apart from the obvious benefits (I'd imagine) for my field, the atmosphere and environment seems like it's everything that's missing from RPI.

You're currently top on my list of potential graduate schools. I'm working with a 3.84gpa with positive first *and* second derivatives -- if you approximate it as a continuous function -- two active research projects, and a pretty decent network of professors and departmental references.

So, how's graduate life at CalTech? What's a typical week(end) look like? What don't I know -- what's the catch?

Academically and professionally, apart from what I know from researching the school and talking with people in the field who've attended or worked there, is there anything outstanding that's going to be different from other, similar graduate schools?

or if you just want to have a chat with an Engineer (yeah. That's our actual mascot. Creative, right?), I'm bored and mostly harmless.

TL;DR NY is cold, can I come live with you?

Thanks for the read!

But I just finished my first semester at college, and it looks like my GPA isn't going to be nearly as good as I was hoping it to be. Looking back, I really screwed up in the last couple of weeks, missing a few labs and online quizes, but it seems like the highest GPA I think I could get for this term is a 2.466, though I think realistically I will be getting something more like a 2.2-2.3. This wouldn't be a problem, except I am not a caltech student, so the requirement for me is a minimum 2.5. This entire situation has me in a bit of a downward spiral as a result. On one hand, I reached out and did a bit of work to try to secure an opportunity, and on the other, I screwed up my first semester. Again, looking back I realize that I definitely didn't do as well as I could have, and if I had put in a little more effort in the final month, I would have had a much better GPA, one that wouldn't take me here for this. And looking forward to my next semester, I am positive that I will be doing much better (I will be getting some help, study groups, etc.)

My question is this; would it be possible to still apply to SURF regardless? I know that in some places, the minimum GPA is more of a ""can you do the work"" kind of thing, which is something I don't have a problem with, and I have no doubt that  my next term GPA (and my GPA for the year) will be well above the 2.5 minimum. Would it be possible to apply with the requirement that my year end GPA is high enough/use my mid-semester grades in the consideration? or am I in the very awkward position of having to let the professor know that I will be withdrawing my interest because of academic difficulties?

0.0,1343003669.0,5.0,caltech,"It was [announced a few days ago](http://features.caltech.edu/features/407) that Caltech will be offering online courses through Courera. In fact, Caltech is not just going to offer courses on Coursera, Caltech is actually becoming an [equity investor](http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/coursera-signs-agreements-with-caltech-duke-epfl-lausanne-georgia-tech-johns-hopkins-1680491.htm) in Coursera.

Was there any open discussion of this on campus beforehand, or is this out of the blue?

There was some grumbling over one of the Stanford online classes by students in the ""real"" class that their course was getting dumbed down to make it more suitable for the online audience, and that the edited online lectures were better than the in-class lectures. Are steps being taken to make sure that doesn't happen with Caltech courses?

So far, three Caltech courses have been announced on Coursera:

[Principles of Economics for Scientists](https://www.coursera.org/course/econ1scientists) by Antonio Rangel. I don't see anything saying what Caltech offline course it corresponds to, but it does say it will be taught concurrently to online and Caltech students, so I assume it corresponds to something.

[Galaxies and Cosmology](https://www.coursera.org/course/cosmo) by S. George Djorgovski. It says it corresponds to Ay 21, but doesn't say if it actually will be taught concurrently and identically to live Ay 21.

[Drugs and the Brain](https://www.coursera.org/course/drugsandbrain) by Henry A. Lester. No idea what this corresponds to.

As far as I know, Caltech has only done one other foray into full online classes with homework, exams, and discussion forums--the [Learning from Data](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) course offered earlier this year by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa, and currently being offered again. From what I've read, the online students greatly liked that class. How was it received on campus? Did having the lectures filmed and broadcast live, and having online students able to submit questions for the Q&amp;A after each class cause any annoyance for the on-campus students?

Finally, is anyone surprised Caltech is going with Coursera instead of one of the other online education initiatives? My guess would have been that when Caltech made a move into online education, it would have been by joining MIT and Harvard on [edX](http://www.edxonline.org/).",Coursera and Caltech?,t3_wznpb,5.0,1.0,harlows_monkeys

City of Pasadena, CA: Improve East-West Bike Routes on Cordova Ave, Green, Union, Del Mar Ave
http://chn.ge/Melvqg

Pasadena needs to improve its east-west bike routes! Cordova Ave has been considered for a road diet for some time ( http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/Transportation/Road_Diet_FAQs/ ) and has had bike lanes installed on it east of Lake Ave. These have improved the safety of cyclists in that area. However, Cordova Ave west of Lake Ave is still intimidating to cyclists. Overall, Pasadena lacks good east-west routes for cyclists.
We petition the City of Pasadena to extend bike lanes on Cordova Ave west of Lake Ave, and to consider installing bike lanes on very wide one-way streets Green St and Union St. In addition, also consider placing bike sharrows on Del Mar Ave to improve the use of this route for cyclists. These improvements will create an east-west bike corridor for Pasadena and help make streets safer for everyone - cyclists, pedestrians, and cars alike.

Please help us by signing this petition! We aim to gather at least 1,000 signatures to present at the Pasadena General Plan Community Forum Meetings coming up on June 23 and 26.

I'll be starting my PhD at Caltech in the fall and I'm just wondering what the social atmosphere is like. I know, I know, no time for friends, blah blah, etc. But seriously, the impression I get thus far from students in my department us that there are a lot of pretty laid back but the undergrad population is a little... uptight.

Anywho, I'm asking because I probably operate on a little bit if a different social schedule than the typical grad student. Or maybe I don't, and you can assuage my fears that I won't find anyone with whom to make stupid decisions after a long week of making good ones. Any current grad students want to chime in?

In Ruddock House, there was a tradition called ""1 yard line."" You would yell that just as you jumped on someone who was sleeping on a couch in the common areas.  Another 10-15 guys would pile on top. That tradition died. 

Ruddock had a number of magazine subscriptions, including Playboy.  The upperclass women all demanded that the subscription be cancelled or they would all move out.  The subscription was cancelled and 10 on-campus members got their own subscriptions.  

One prank that didn't work out was the Banners in the Rose Bowl Goalposts.  The plan was to have them unfurl during halftime.  A timer to turn on the radio-controlled airplane receiver would not work reliably, so a large number of batteries were used instead and the receiver set to an obscure frequency.  These were installed 3 weeks before the Rose Bowl when security was nonexistent.  Little did we know that there would be a radio-controlled airplane exhibition 1/2 a mile away from the stadium 2 weeks before the game.....sigh.  What did the banners read?  ""Hi, Mom! It's your son from Caltech!"" and ""Send more women!""

I'm a Caltech alum who got into Caltech with what was probably a typical record for Caltech students: valedictorian, near perfect SAT's, lots of AP exams and 5's on all of them, impressive math and science competition results. On iqtest.dk, which is said to be one of the more accurate online IQ tests, I scored 110, which is only considered the high end of average or slightly above average. On other online IQ tests I can't break 130. I've never taken an official IQ test, but on standardized tests as a kid, I scored very well in verbal intelligence but extremely poorly in spatial skills.

Incidentally, I found Caltech's academics to be very difficult. Post-Caltech, my success has been mediocre. I've always come across as slow to other people, including those who didn't do well in school. ","Caltech students and alumni, what is your IQ if you know it?",t3_kpwjk,0.0,0.44,burdalane
