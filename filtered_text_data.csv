invited anywhere given even time ruminate already unhealthy bad thoughts melting together really letting first semester kind sucked know wasnt worst possibly could sure wasnt good know pretty normal many things bad part broader problems know wont magically resolve feel really angry lately intensification previous constant feelings sadness emptiness paranoia selfblame stretched back since early high school memories semester close eyes reenvision state mind time think routine walks tofrom dhall class wherever minimal exception could ever recall feeling angry sad nothing constant around second week classes feeling nothing either distinctly bad nothing flat flat feeling wasnt much better bad would devolve bad drop hat didnt go good something cool could happen could feel relaxed bad ruminations mean inner criticisms would crowd feelings quickly look back hardly remember good times even happened end semester felt like slowly losing spirit fading something vaguer vaguer every day felt like even worse even less likable version whatever confused sad thing beforemy approach feelings semester mostly isolate got really negative spiral ended pretty often first weeks would avoid developing friendships didnt want friends despite efforts cheer honestly really really difficult appear cold dismissive terse conversation even though none single thing person turned absolute asshat moods explicitly mean certainly never talked people really normal good days great meals felt fine slipped back sort funny chill self didnt enough im worried withdrawn brooding side people might remember could done much better gave withdrew many times dhall classes meetings ec could done much better even know manage could tried harder im really concerned longterm effects behavior future ability make friends im paranoid people image angry loner maybe kind irrational maybe im angry let side come often people get angry come verisad youre supposed develop methods control youre adult ive done shit job shouldnt let get handim really disgusted feel like thats best way could describe sometimes like kind step outside look inward kind cringe ew look im performing particularly well school

semester got gym times totally burnt outi know mean inner critical voice talking thing feel like tend say things like dont listen critical inner voice irrational problem feel like mine actually pretty rational really seem deserve selfcriticism personality lacking somewhere make logic anything inference best explanation take reallife evidence dont friends im getting hit never dated anyone im lonely person capable outgoing somewhat funny somewhere along way motor burns somehow cant make keep friends im extremely desirable friend partner material getting better know change anything change could get better sure could get worse told things would change better high school senior year forget dec th thought holding golden ticket finally way feeling normal fulfilled crowd remember fever holidays binged housing day videos came memorized flags mascots watched adams rap video one awe feeling fuzzy like special inside joke well surprise reversal fortune even knows ill blocking group ill less month figure wish gave little effort couldnt suck get back horse thats life getting back horse couldnt dont know get better wish could sorry person ever unfairly dismissive toward want know sorry wasnt fault also absolutely awful consider possibility could contributed even bad feelings others acted like continued cycle made worse everyone helped screw aggregate pleasure even little anyone ever someone act mad around reason im sorry behalf maybe didnt deserve thatif anyone else similar feelings first semester wants share insight would really appreciate im currently talking someone camhs sort
