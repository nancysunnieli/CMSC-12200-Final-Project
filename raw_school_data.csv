I'm an incoming law student this fall and wanted to get a sanity check from all of u Cambridge veterans. I'm sorry for the vague and nooby nature of these questions, but I've never actually hunted for apartments or even dorms.

Seeing the rent rates in Cambridge coming from a mid-size Midwestern city is quite jarring; is $2000+ really a fair rate throughout Cambridge for a studio apartment? Is Harvard University Housing (HUH) a good route to go, or would I be better off looking at other private landlords? Or, even further, is my best bet just getting on-campus housing? Are there any Harvard-specific peculiarities in the housing process I should be aware of? If any of you are from the Midwest, what would you recommend for me to look out for in terms of particularly drastic changes in lifestyle/climate?

Also, while I'm here I figure I'll ask, even though no one possibly has an answer: what's you guys' ascertainment of the administration's attitude towards potentially returning to campus this fall? I go to a large state school that never really vacated campus except for the tail-end of spring 2020 (i.e. students are still living on campus and going to physical, albeit altered/hybrid classes), but I understand that Harvard's approach has been more cautious. Just wondering if there's any word on the street.

0.0,17.0,"Hello all,

We would like to open up a discussion about Rule 2 of the sub. This is a checkup to make sure it reflects the needs and desires of this subreddit. This isn't in response to a particular event; this is just something we have come across several times and I figure it would be best to just let everyone discuss it and come to a consensus (if that's not too optimistic). 

As of this post, rule 2 is:

&gt; 2) No advertising or soliciting non-Harvard sponsored products, apps, surveys, or other materials.*
&gt; 
&gt; *: Special arrangements can be made to advertise officially recognized events and organizations directly related to Harvard subject to moderator approval. Contact the moderators directly to inquire.
&gt; 

This rule is meant to filter posts that advertise things.

The wording and conditions of Rule 2 have changed slightly over the years; for a while it was just ""No advertising or soliciting""; then we added ""of non-Harvard sponsored ...""; then we added the asterisk. The original intent of the rule was to filter out spammy posts advertising because of the subreddit's name and reputation. However, there are of course legitimate things to advertise so we had to figure out how to best draw the line, hence all the changes. 

---

As it stands, the current rule requires that any person or organization not officially recognized by the University seek moderator approval before advertising an event, service, opportunity, etc. There have been plenty of queries that we've denied, but there have been some that we have approved. The MO for our decision-making is: ""is this advertisement useful, relevant, and legitimate?"" For example, the [Jeopardy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/jo2g8j/the_jeopardy_national_college_championship/) post was useful, relevant, and legitimate. However, there are some advertisements that we don't think meet those criteria (e.g. a high school tutoring company seeking to hire Harvard student tutors). We believe something like that crosses the line into spam and/or reputation-seeking. 

Please chime in below with your thoughts on the current rule, and if there are any changes or tweaks you would like to see. For example, do you agree with the two instances I gave above?

0.0,0.0,"Hi all,

Princeton has long been my dream school (more precisely, since sophomore year). You will see this reflected in the breakdown of my performance. 

I have a few LD’s, such as a bad case of ADHD and NVLD. I attended a special needs middle school and now attend a small prep school in NYC. Freshman year was challenging, as I was behind on the material and had anxiety from the greater expectations. I caught up over that summer, and perhaps fortuitously visited Princeton then too. I thought it impossible to ever attend, given my poor academic career. Nonetheless, I was inspired by the campus and kept it in mind. I worked diligently in sophomore year, saw significant improvement, and continue to now as a junior. 

One of my concerns lies in the fact that I never enrolled in an AP course. My school offers five across sophomore, junior, and senior years. In sophomore year, I had no chance of enrolling in one given my class trajectory. I applied for them this year, but didn’t get admitted. I was, however, enrolled in two honors courses for the first time. I plan on taking two APs and at least two honors next year as well. Could this “AP” dilemma be explained away, or will it irreparably damage my application? 

I have also heard that Princeton doesn’t consider freshman grades, but they are listed below in case that isn’t true - and for context. 

Anyway, here are my grades, **potential** test scores, extracurriculars, and awards across my three years of high school.


Intended major: Literature

*My school uses the 100 scale for GPA. I will make conversions to the 4.0 scale. 

- 9th grade: 81 GPA (2.7)
- 10th grade: 95 GPA (4.0)
- 11th grade (thus far): 95 GPA (4.0)

Class rank: 19/65 (brought down by 9th grade, would likely be top 10 without it) 

I will be taking the August SAT. My goal is a 1500+, and I intend to spend my breaks and summer studying. I have a private tutor and ample resources to realize this goal. In the event that I don’t, I may go test-optional. 

Current extracurriculars: 

- President and founder of Debate Society
- Editor of and contributor to school literary magazine
- Publisher for school newsletter
- Peer tutor
- Member of history tournament team

Planned additions:

- Debate Society competing in tournament
- Receiving recognition outside of school for literary works (publishing newspaper in local publication, submitting poetry online). 
- Delivering speeches at venues (likely virtual) over summer or in fall

It’s a simple list, I know - but these are the things I chose to do out of genuine passion. I’ve heard that less is more when it comes to EC’s, but please be the judge of that. 

Current awards:

- Deans List for two consecutive years
- Spanish department award (10th grade)
- Science department award (10th grade)

Projected additions: 

- At least two more department awards
- Awards for school extracurriculars (Debate Society tournament, school literary magazine, newsletter)

I don’t believe anyone from my school has been admitted to Princeton - or at least not for many years, but all other Ivies (with the exception of Dartmouth) and other top schools regularly take students from here. It may be because they don’t apply to Princeton (I haven’t heard of anyone doing so). 

I realize a lot of this is hypothetical. But if I do realize these academic goals, would I have a chance at Princeton? I intend to apply restrictive E.A. so they know how strong and personal this desire is.

I am not particularly hell-bent on getting all As, but I am currently failing two classes and am on the verge of failing another. I am pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADHD/executive function disorder, and I am going currently untreated for GAD. I seem to start assignments and cannot continue studying for more than 10 minutes at a time, after that I begin actively seeking distractions (napping, online browsing, cooking, chores etc). Additionally, I struggle to remember quantitative material, which makes my STEM courses particularly difficult to understand as most derivations are initially too difficult for me to understand. I think I would be able to focus or pass my classes if I maybe had one or two classes with no precepts or labs. 

What i've currently been doing to minimize my burnout has not been working. I stay in regular contact with my DSL, but I do not interact in any with my RCA or PAA as I genuinely do not enjoy my previous interactions with them or my advisory groups. I have been looking for a therapist to for my GAD for the past 8 weeks and I do not have my first appointment with them until after midterms. I am increasing the amount of times I go to office hours, but I notice for some of my classes that I do not have questions for my professors during office hours because they went over the material I am lost on over a week ago. I currently have a McGraw tutor in one of the classes I am not failing, but the limited amount of time does not allow me to learn the material in the way I need to actually retain it. I find it difficult to study regularly throughout the week, either I will spend 7+ hours of pomodoro method studying or I will do nothing all day. 

Has anyone else struggled this much with online learning, and is their anything I can do to  get my grades under control now? This current way of studying is unsustainable, and I am not of privilege to be able to take a gap year or defer in the future.

0.0,2.0,"Hi! I’m an UCI research assistant and I was assigned the task of understanding how major selection works in a few top colleges, one of which includes Princeton. I was wondering if you guys could help me out with a few of your opinions; it definitely doesn’t have to be objective, I’m grateful for all the information, however subjective, I can collect. I've already perused the website and statements by admission officers, but I wanted to hear from actual students, so educated guesses (or even speculation) are all appreciated!

So, here are the questions:

1. Does Princeton require you to input an intended major on your application? Can you put undeclared?
2. If Princeton does require an intended major, after you’re accepted to Princeton with that intended major, does Princeton expect you to follow through? For instance, if a student picked “Computer Science,” will Princeton funnel that student into an engineering department and expect him/her to take engineering courses and activities, or does Princeton really treat everyone the same way no matter what they picked for intended major (at least until they declare)? Is there a limiting of options in regards to classes, activities, etc. for certain majors, even unintentionally?
3. I saw that there was a deadline difference between A.B. and B.S.E degrees, with B.S.E degrees having an earlier declared major deadline. Do you think this affects major selection/major changes (or generally anything about majors) in any way?
4. When does Princeton expect students to declare their majors by? Can a student be truly “Undeclared” up until the point of declaring their majors?
5. And lastly, based on your opinion, does intended major affect admissions? A lot of colleges I’ve looked into have stated publicly that the intended major does not affect admissions, but we also know diversity in ideologies (and thus major) is also important. This, of course, is a very touchy subject and I’m definitely not expecting the absolute, objective truth for this question; just wanted to hear your thoughts.

Other than these questions, if you have any other comments you could share about how students are pressured to take certain majors over others at Princeton, and any reason they would change their major: they would be appreciated!

* How has your experience in the New Haven area been?
* Is there a ""superiority"" complex among students with regards to Harvard? That's the vibe I've gotten from admitted students chats so far.

Hey everyone! I was accepted to Yale REA and think I'll commit soon. It's my dream school and I can't see myself anywhere else. But, I wanted to see if anyone on this sub could help inform me before I make a final decision.

Firstly, I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to major in, but I know it will be in either chemistry or biology. As of now, I'm probably doing Molecular Biophysics &amp; Biochemistry. But, I have no clue what I want to do as a career, and wouldn't be surprised if I decided to switch to an Econ or Data Science/Stats major. The thing I liked about Yale was the ability to easily switch majors, I know some schools are tough since you have to transfer between colleges, but that's not the case at Yale.

Yale is also a very humanities-heavy school, but from what I've read, it's been pouring A LOT into improving its STEM programs. I don't see this as a large issue, since I enjoy humanities as much as STEM, just can't see myself majoring in anything non-STEM. The reason I didn't apply to a school like MIT is b/c I value the importance of a liberal arts education that Yale provides. Yale seems like a great school for general science (biology, physics, chem, etc. which I hope to do). It also seems like there are endless opportunities for research which interest me as well. Could anyone that's majoring in STEM talk about their experiences?

Finally, more general stuff. How's New Haven? Do you find yourself stuck in a ""Yale bubble"" or do you get the chance to explore? Do you connect with students from surrounding colleges at all?

The financial aid was great, so that’s not a concern. My family wants me to commit as well.

The “problem” (extremely good problem to have, I almost feel bad even worrying about an acceptance to YALE) is that I’m a STEM student. I don’t really know what I wanna do with my life, but I’ve gone to a STEM high school and that is more than likely what I’ll end up majoring in. I do have interests outside of math/science, and loved the idea of getting to know a variety of people in Yale residential colleges and having a liberal arts education. However, everything I’ve read says Yale isn’t that strong in STEM. 

I know at this caliber (for undergrad especially?) the distinctions of the relative strengths of the fields aren’t THAT relevant, but I keep feeling like I might be ill advised not trying for Stanford and Princeton (as a potential engineering student) even though I like Yale more... do any STEM students at Yale have something to say about the strength of stem, why you chose Yale as a stem student, etc? Also, how are the graduate school prospects in STEM from Yale, as compared to a more heavily STEM school? 

Again, I know this is dumb. Yale is amazing, fit is the most important thing, etc, etc, I’m just stressed about it and would love to hear from Yalies in this kind of situation.

I can’t believe this is literally three months after they settled the class action lawsuit about not providing good 401(k) options. What, was that a slap on the wrist? I’ve only looked up one of the fun so far but it’s the index fund and it has .31% fees versus the .02% that the Vanguard fund it is replacing has. Can we *do* something?

Dear MIT 401(k) Plan Participant,

On behalf of MIT, the MIT Supplemental 401(k) Oversight Committee (“Committee”) regularly monitors and reviews the investment options offered in the 401(k) Plan. Recently, the Committee, with the guidance of its investment consultant, has decided to replace nine funds in the Plan with similar plans from the same asset classes. This fund change will occur during the evening of February 22, 2021. You are not required to take any action. The following is an explanation of the change and when it will occur. 

What Funds Will Be Changed?

The following funds will be replaced:

Current Fund to Be Eliminated	Replacement Fund

Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock U.S. Debt Income Fund F

Vanguard Total Stock Market Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock Russell 3000 Index Fund F

Vanguard Value Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Value Fund F

Vanguard Growth Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Growth Fund F

Vanguard Mid‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Mid Capitalization Equity Index Fund F

Vanguard Small‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 2000 Index Fund F

Vanguard US‐Real Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock FTSE EPRA/NARIET U.S. Index Fund F

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock MSCI ACWI ex‐U.S. IMI Index Fund F

Vanguard Emerging‐Markets Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund F

If you have invested in any of the current funds listed above, your investments will be moved automatically to the corresponding replacement fund. Your election to have future contributions invested in any of the current funds will also be automatically changed to the corresponding replacement funds. No action on your part is required.

The replacement funds are very similar to the current funds. They are of the same asset class; invest in many of the same securities; and follow a similar, though slightly different, market index. As always, we encourage all Plan participants to review their 401(k) account allocation regularly to confirm that it continues to be compatible with their retirement savings strategy.

Fact sheets for the new funds will be available in early February on the MIT Human Resources website at https://hr.mit.edu/benefits/401k and will also be posted on Fidelity’s NetBenefits website in late February.

When Is the Fund Change Happening?

The fund transfer will be made during the evening of February 22, 2021. Any fund transfers that you request before 4:00 pm EST on February 22, 2021, will be made before the current funds are replaced. Any of your investments that are automatically transferred to the new funds will be available for you to review on the Fidelity NetBenefits website after 7:00 am EST, February 23, 2021.

Why Are the Funds Being Changed?

The Committee regularly reviews the performance and fees of the investment options in the Plan. As part of this due diligence, it compared certain funds in the Plan to outside options with similar characteristics, evaluating their respective performance, index tracking variance, fund transaction costs and fund management fees. After completing its review, the Committee chose to replace the nine funds described above.

Information from Fidelity

Later this week, Fidelity will send you an announcement with detailed information about the fund changes. Please take the time to read the Fidelity announcement so you are fully informed about the changes taking place.

If you have questions, please contact the Fidelity Benefits Center at 877-648-7283 or MIT Benefits at benefits@mit.edu or 617-253-6151.

0.0,28.0,"To the members of the MIT community,

Following the Goodwin Procter report on MIT’s interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, President Reif asked that I create a process to review its findings about Professor Seth Lloyd and to identify any appropriate action. I created a two-part review and decision-making process with two faculty committees: one to review facts and determine, based on those facts, whether Professor Lloyd violated any MIT policy, and the second to recommend disciplinary action, if necessary. I write today to share the results of this intensive two-stage effort and the decision I have reached. 

Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that I am taking the unusual step of sharing this information with our entire community because of the unique public nature of the case and its impacts. Professor Lloyd knows that I am taking this step, and he understands and accepts that the outcome of this disciplinary process should be shared openly.

The Review Panel

I assembled a panel of five senior faculty leaders from across the Institute and asked them to determine if Professor Lloyd violated MIT policies. The members of the panel were Professor Rohan Abeyaratne, Institute Professor Daron Acemoglu, Institute Professor Penny Chisholm, Materials Science and Engineering Department Head Jeffrey Grossman, and Dean of Science Nergis Mavalvala (chair). The panel members reviewed the Goodwin report as well as other documents they deemed relevant and met with a number of individuals, including the Goodwin fact-finders and Professor Lloyd, several times.  

Based on this review, a majority of the members found that, in connection with donations he received from Epstein in 2012, Professor Lloyd violated MIT’s conflict of interest policy (Policies &amp; Procedures 4.4) by failing to inform MIT that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that, in doing so, he violated MIT’s policy on faculty misconduct (Policies &amp; Procedures 3.4.2). A minority of the members could not conclude one way or the other that his actions violated the conflict of interest policy. 

The full panel further determined that he did not violate any MIT policies in accepting a gift from Epstein in 2005–2006 and a donation in 2017. The panel members did not find that Professor Lloyd tried to circumvent the MIT vetting process nor that he sought to conceal the name of the donor. They did conclude, however, that he failed to reveal crucial information about Epstein’s background to anyone at MIT.

The Evaluation Committee

The panel submitted its findings to a separate evaluation committee consisting of Dean of Engineering Anantha Chandrakasan, Mechanical Engineering Department Head Evelyn Wang, Physics Department Head Peter Fisher, Mechanical Engineering Associate Department Head Pierre Lermusiaux, and Faculty Chair Rick Danheiser. The evaluation committee convened several times, including meetings with the review panel members and with Professor Lloyd. Based on the panel’s conclusions, the evaluation committee recommended a set of disciplinary actions, which they stated ""focused on Professor Lloyd’s poor judgment and the impact of his actions on the community, which he may not have yet fully appreciated.""

My Decision

After conferring with senior administrative and faculty leaders, as well as the two committees, I have decided to implement the recommended disciplinary actions. 

For a period of five years, a set of disciplinary actions will limit Professor Lloyd’s compensation, his ability to engage in solicitation of donors and foundations, and his involvement in first-year undergraduate advising, and will impose several other restrictions on normal privileges accorded to a faculty member. In addition, Professor Lloyd will be expected to undergo training on professional conduct before resuming certain activities on campus, including teaching. 

These steps cannot undo the harm done. Professor Lloyd’s failure to share what he knew about Epstein’s conviction when he accepted his 2012 donations was unacceptable. His interactions with Epstein and certain of his actions surrounding acceptance of the donations serve to highlight the importance of the current Institute-wide effort to develop clearer guidelines for engaging with donors. 

I recognize that many in our community remain deeply disturbed by the interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and that some will be disappointed by this decision. In addition, for some, this outcome may renew past pain. If you feel you would benefit from support or guidance at this time, you can find a range of resources here.

I would like to close by extending my gratitude to the entire MIT community for your engagement, your candor, and your care for MIT.

there is also the side factor that these units would have been in classes that all felt pretty meaningless/purposeless, which may have been why i felt so much less motivation than on campus. also, i am doing way more extracurriculars this year.

To say that I am disappointed by the lack of solidarity from the Stanford community, would be an understatement.

I implore you to think about our equal moral worth as human beings, and more than that, about our shared claim to the Stanford experience. Have we not all studied in Green Library, snuck onto the roof at MemChu, ate a delicious hot dog at Caspar dining? Does this mean nothing to you?

The vitriol and anger currently circulating will engender harrowing consequences for our institution and for the free market system.

Although I'd appreciate any advice or comments, soliciting them isn't my intention.

I'm currently living on campus with my friends. I love them all; they're incredibly chill, full of energy and fun to be around. But as an international student, I feel out of place. There are so many references that go over my head, like the cartoons and TV shows they watched growing up, the music hits of middle school and vines that I've never been exposed to. It feels really hard to relate or contribute to conversations. Often, I feel like I have no opinions about things. My friends would debate which Miley Cyrus song is the best banger or which Disney channel actor/actress turned to be the hottest as they grew up. I've never really thought about those things, and don't understand the circumstances that would force one to, yet my friends seem to have immediate strong opinions about these things and have come up with lines of reasoning explaining their positions. Coupled with the fact that half the time I don't know what they're debating, it always feels like I'm just an observer in the friend group. I feel like they forget I exist, and by extension I feel like an outsider.

It doesn't help that I already have issues with active listening, vocabulary recall or expressing myself on the spot. English is not my first language, and I've only been conversing in it for a few years. This is also exacerbated by the fact that 18 years of living with a manipulative, hot-tempered mom has taught me to be agreeable and actively seek to please the people around me. I often just nod, smile or laugh, not knowing what for. These reflexes seem to be programmed in me. Whenever I try to overcome them, try to be true to myself, I'm hit with self-worth issues. Nothing about my life, at least to me, seems worth sharing. I don't have any funny anecdotes, while my friends always seem to have something funny that's happened to them recently. Adding to that, I hate my body, every bit of it. Although I know that my friends don't view my as ugly per se, they always throw around the word ""fat"" negatively. It makes me question if that connotation carries in the way the see me.

Perhaps the only time where I'm truly able to be ""me"", is when I'm drunk or high. So whenever I have the chance to, I always get really drunk, and try to get everyone around me to be drunk. It's the only time where I know I have an excuse if I say something that people would conventionally deem stupid or of no value to the conversation. Heck, my friends would just laugh because they're drunk. It's the only time where I can say the word ""like"" six times in the same sentence because I don't know what the English word for the specific thing I'm trying to describe is. People would think I'm just too drunk, that I'm not dumb. This has been very unhealthy because drinking alcohol or smoking weed seem to ruin my mood for the next few days.

So, even though I'm surrounded by people I love and admire, who I know I can count on, I feel alone. I don't know how I'd ever bring this up to them. Hell, saying this makes me question if they really see me as a friend or they just keep me around because I'm a ""generally nice person"". And the thing is, I know they're good people, but I also know that they wouldn't know how to respond or act if I ever told them this. I don't even know how to begin expressing myself, like would I call a ""friend group meeting"" and put myself under the spotlight? That just seems too dramatic. Even if I manage to do that, I know the moment I start to speak, my entire vocabulary will just disappear, my thoughts and feelings will no longer feel valid or worth listening to. I can't bear the feeling of making anyone feel even a little bit bad or sad. My whole life prior to Stanford was walking on egg shells trying not to trigger my mom, not to have her throw shit and break shit, not to hear her scream and stop talking to me for days on end.

All of these things, and many other things, compounded with school work and fucking PWR2 (that seems to incorporate even more work than a normal year would have) serves only to fuel sixty different voices in my head that I have no control over. I can't stop thinking. I can't stop hating myself, hating the circumstances that made me the way I am, hating every piece of my existence. Closing my eyes, and imagining my existence melt away is the only thing that brings me peace. I don't know what to do with myself. I've been trying so hard, but there's very little left in me.

1. Which track should I apply to, given that (i) my top choice is the finance track, (ii) I have no finance work experience, and (iii) my profile is much more relevant for data science?

So, I'm using my AP Spanish test for the language requirement, and am thinking of taking AP Biology (4,5), AP Statistics (5), AP Calculus BC (4,5\*), and AP Physics C: Mechanics (5).                                                                 \* ^(I probably need a 5 for the 18000 math sequence)

My school does not offer AP Physics C: Mechanics, so I'm currently trying to self-study for it (in a semester), so I wanted to ask if any of you recommend I take it at UChicago instead (so that I can discard it totally from my list since self-studying leaves many gaps in understanding &amp; is just overwhelming to do it simultaneously with my Calc self-study.... while having a bunch of other things to do in school and at home....not me venting :-|).

The Bio, Stats, Calc, and Spanish credit look, overall, more helpful. But, I was starting to think about dropping the Calc BC to take the Physics C, to only depend on the placement test (which I was advised by some of you is not ideal to place into the 18000s). So, Physics C is the problem right now...

It just seems ironic, considering that no small portion of the people now silent were the ones most aggressively pestering kids in our class when the celebration screenshots came out. It seems that personal opinions are coloring the social/political positions being held, which, I guess when you think about it, isn't actually that surprising. Of course, for the people who are staying consistent to ""holding people accountable,"" good on you.

Now, I don't think there's any point in dragging this whole affair with the slideshow out longer. Was the powerpoint mean? Of course it was, and I hope those in it (who aren't taking it lightly, because, fair enough, even if personally I find the situation pretty humorous, I can see how it would be significantly less humorous if I was in it) realize the irrelevancy of the opinions of the idiot kids who made it and aren't hit too hard by it.

Still, I don't think there's any benefit to hounding the makers of the powerpoint. Won't achieve much, most likely. Plus, forgive and forget and all that stuff. Not just here, but in general.

Started my timer right after the guy at the front told me I could go in. I sprinted to the counter closest to me and smashed my PennCard on there before doing a lateral lunge to the #1 desk.

Up until now I had been collecting spit and I had exactly 2mL in my mouth at this point. ""Hohn Thmith, May fif,"" I yelled before grabbing a handful of vials, alcohol wipes, and the entire printer to save time as I ran over to station #10. I uncapped the vial and hurled my salivary juices into it while I used my toes to rip open the alcohol wipe. I ran towards the nurse and started reeling my arm back, before pitching my vial, label, and the entire printer from earlier to her at 60mph once I got to the 6 ft. mark. I  made sure to take the entire hand sanitizer bottle as I ran towards the exit, as public health&gt;&gt;speedrunning.

Although it was clearly stated in the syllabus and at the top of the quiz that calculators were not allowed, I did this because the question asked for a numerical answer and that you might not be able to give a decimal answer without a calculator. I misinterpreted this as permission to use a calculator on the last step of the integral instead of just plugging in the bounds and simplifying.

Now I have a 0% on this quiz and cannot replace it with the redo, which means that my final grade potential is lowered 7%. I emailed the professor and explained my mistake as I did in this post, but he is sticking with his initial punishment.

* What's the exchange student experience like in general? Does anyone know any past exchange students I could get in contact with?

* Are there any really cool courses I should take? I'm not too much of an astrophysicist, but I'm open to suggestions.

I read on Caltech’s website that I must apply on regular decision for getting this aid. I also read that if anyone applies during the early action period is allowed to apply to other colleges. So here’s my question: If I apply on regular decision (because that’s what I should do for getting financial aid), am I allowed to apply to other colleges?. I want to apply to other universities as a backup plan, but if I get accepted into Caltech I totally would study there.

* We do not believe that those protocols have direct implications for graduate students who live in apartment settings and engage in laboratory research regulated by other workplace protocols.
* In light of the ongoing public health risks to our community, we discourage undergraduate students from moving to Pasadena in order to live near campus.
* The Undergraduate Deans' Office and Office of Residential Experience will establish virtual living/learning groups for first-year students, with regular interactions and engagements with an assigned faculty advisor and undergraduate peer and graduate mentors.

The offer is for physics, not engineering, however—engineering decisions haven't released yet. 

I'm now considering moving my JHU app to RD, as I would be committed to pay full tuition (70k/year) if accepted to Hopkins with EDII.

AMS on the other hand is a tried and true path that has seen thousands of graduates receive their degrees and go on to be highly successful. Though perhaps it lacks more practical skills such as programming that the Data Science degree does a better job of covering.

0.0,0.0,"Hi all,

So as I’m sure many people have noticed, we have very harsh restrictions (no people in your room, no sitting in hallways, no common areas for now, mask mandate when running alone outside, etc). These rules are obviously sparking mental health issues in many freshmen. However, I don’t really want to argue about whether they are fully justified or not right now; I understand that we have a responsibility to protect the Baltimore community. My concern is for later in the semester and looking forward to the fall.

By some point in mid March, a year after all of this really started, the vast majority of healthcare workers and elderly will have had the opportunity to receive the vaccine. This is amazing, because the vaccine so far seems to be 95% effective at preventing illness but 100% effective at preventing hospitalization. Since the vast majority of deaths (I believe 80%+, but correct me if I’m wrong) have occurred in people over the age of 65, this will reduce to death rate to be on par with a seasonal flu. On top of that, overall transmission rates will be cut as we slowly approach the heard immunity threshold.

However, because college aged students are incredibly low risk (I believe that death rate for people under 20 is .003%) we are dead last in line for the vaccine. This makes sense, if we want to reduce deaths then we need to prioritize vaccinating people who actually could die if they catch the virus. HOWEVER, it is not justified, fair, or reasonable for Johns Hopkins, or society as a whole, to continue imposing restrictions on healthy young people when the people we have been protecting for the last year are no longer vulnerable. 

The school has said the restrictions will likely remain in place for the entire semester. This is not based on actual science or data, nor is it good public health policy. Good policy takes into account more than one disease, and at this rate the risk of student suicide is likely much higher than the risk of a student COVID death. We did not have mask mandates, lockdowns, capacity restrictions, etc. for the flu, which is more dangerous to our demographic than COVID is. Therefore, it does not make any sense to continue with restrictions when COVID death rates reach the flu’s (~60k per year).

I am very concerned that the university has dug a hole that will be very difficult to crawl out of without a sensible, set in stone reopening metric. COVID zero, and even full student vaccination, are not reasonable levels to hope for before allowing a semblance of normal. I really hope everyone understands my concern and what I’m trying to say here.",jhu,COVID Restrictions after March,0.0,0.35

I'm an incoming law student this fall and wanted to get a sanity check from all of u Cambridge veterans. I'm sorry for the vague and nooby nature of these questions, but I've never actually hunted for apartments or even dorms.

Seeing the rent rates in Cambridge coming from a mid-size Midwestern city is quite jarring; is $2000+ really a fair rate throughout Cambridge for a studio apartment? Is Harvard University Housing (HUH) a good route to go, or would I be better off looking at other private landlords? Or, even further, is my best bet just getting on-campus housing? Are there any Harvard-specific peculiarities in the housing process I should be aware of? If any of you are from the Midwest, what would you recommend for me to look out for in terms of particularly drastic changes in lifestyle/climate?

Also, while I'm here I figure I'll ask, even though no one possibly has an answer: what's you guys' ascertainment of the administration's attitude towards potentially returning to campus this fall? I go to a large state school that never really vacated campus except for the tail-end of spring 2020 (i.e. students are still living on campus and going to physical, albeit altered/hybrid classes), but I understand that Harvard's approach has been more cautious. Just wondering if there's any word on the street.

0.0,16.0,"Hello all,

We would like to open up a discussion about Rule 2 of the sub. This is a checkup to make sure it reflects the needs and desires of this subreddit. This isn't in response to a particular event; this is just something we have come across several times and I figure it would be best to just let everyone discuss it and come to a consensus (if that's not too optimistic). 

As of this post, rule 2 is:

&gt; 2) No advertising or soliciting non-Harvard sponsored products, apps, surveys, or other materials.*
&gt; 
&gt; *: Special arrangements can be made to advertise officially recognized events and organizations directly related to Harvard subject to moderator approval. Contact the moderators directly to inquire.
&gt; 

This rule is meant to filter posts that advertise things.

The wording and conditions of Rule 2 have changed slightly over the years; for a while it was just ""No advertising or soliciting""; then we added ""of non-Harvard sponsored ...""; then we added the asterisk. The original intent of the rule was to filter out spammy posts advertising because of the subreddit's name and reputation. However, there are of course legitimate things to advertise so we had to figure out how to best draw the line, hence all the changes. 

---

As it stands, the current rule requires that any person or organization not officially recognized by the University seek moderator approval before advertising an event, service, opportunity, etc. There have been plenty of queries that we've denied, but there have been some that we have approved. The MO for our decision-making is: ""is this advertisement useful, relevant, and legitimate?"" For example, the [Jeopardy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/jo2g8j/the_jeopardy_national_college_championship/) post was useful, relevant, and legitimate. However, there are some advertisements that we don't think meet those criteria (e.g. a high school tutoring company seeking to hire Harvard student tutors). We believe something like that crosses the line into spam and/or reputation-seeking. 

Please chime in below with your thoughts on the current rule, and if there are any changes or tweaks you would like to see. For example, do you agree with the two instances I gave above?

(3) Do you think that the extension ALM in Finance/Management if done entirely on-campus is comparable to a traditional MBA/MSF/MS. Management?

(4) How has the experience been overall? Did the ALM program help advance your career goals/prospects?

0.0,0.0,"Hi all,

Princeton has long been my dream school (more precisely, since sophomore year). You will see this reflected in the breakdown of my performance. 

I have a few LD’s, such as a bad case of ADHD and NVLD. I attended a special needs middle school and now attend a small prep school in NYC. Freshman year was challenging, as I was behind on the material and had anxiety from the greater expectations. I caught up over that summer, and perhaps fortuitously visited Princeton then too. I thought it impossible to ever attend, given my poor academic career. Nonetheless, I was inspired by the campus and kept it in mind. I worked diligently in sophomore year, saw significant improvement, and continue to now as a junior. 

One of my concerns lies in the fact that I never enrolled in an AP course. My school offers five across sophomore, junior, and senior years. In sophomore year, I had no chance of enrolling in one given my class trajectory. I applied for them this year, but didn’t get admitted. I was, however, enrolled in two honors courses for the first time. I plan on taking two APs and at least two honors next year as well. Could this “AP” dilemma be explained away, or will it irreparably damage my application? 

I have also heard that Princeton doesn’t consider freshman grades, but they are listed below in case that isn’t true - and for context. 

Anyway, here are my grades, **potential** test scores, extracurriculars, and awards across my three years of high school.


Intended major: Literature

*My school uses the 100 scale for GPA. I will make conversions to the 4.0 scale. 

- 9th grade: 81 GPA (2.7)
- 10th grade: 95 GPA (4.0)
- 11th grade (thus far): 95 GPA (4.0)

Class rank: 19/65 (brought down by 9th grade, would likely be top 10 without it) 

I will be taking the August SAT. My goal is a 1500+, and I intend to spend my breaks and summer studying. I have a private tutor and ample resources to realize this goal. In the event that I don’t, I may go test-optional. 

Current extracurriculars: 

- President and founder of Debate Society
- Editor of and contributor to school literary magazine
- Publisher for school newsletter
- Peer tutor
- Member of history tournament team

Planned additions:

- Debate Society competing in tournament
- Receiving recognition outside of school for literary works (publishing newspaper in local publication, submitting poetry online). 
- Delivering speeches at venues (likely virtual) over summer or in fall

It’s a simple list, I know - but these are the things I chose to do out of genuine passion. I’ve heard that less is more when it comes to EC’s, but please be the judge of that. 

Current awards:

- Deans List for two consecutive years
- Spanish department award (10th grade)
- Science department award (10th grade)

Projected additions: 

- At least two more department awards
- Awards for school extracurriculars (Debate Society tournament, school literary magazine, newsletter)

I don’t believe anyone from my school has been admitted to Princeton - or at least not for many years, but all other Ivies (with the exception of Dartmouth) and other top schools regularly take students from here. It may be because they don’t apply to Princeton (I haven’t heard of anyone doing so). 

I realize a lot of this is hypothetical. But if I do realize these academic goals, would I have a chance at Princeton? I intend to apply restrictive E.A. so they know how strong and personal this desire is.

I am not particularly hell-bent on getting all As, but I am currently failing two classes and am on the verge of failing another. I am pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADHD/executive function disorder, and I am going currently untreated for GAD. I seem to start assignments and cannot continue studying for more than 10 minutes at a time, after that I begin actively seeking distractions (napping, online browsing, cooking, chores etc). Additionally, I struggle to remember quantitative material, which makes my STEM courses particularly difficult to understand as most derivations are initially too difficult for me to understand. I think I would be able to focus or pass my classes if I maybe had one or two classes with no precepts or labs. 

What i've currently been doing to minimize my burnout has not been working. I stay in regular contact with my DSL, but I do not interact in any with my RCA or PAA as I genuinely do not enjoy my previous interactions with them or my advisory groups. I have been looking for a therapist to for my GAD for the past 8 weeks and I do not have my first appointment with them until after midterms. I am increasing the amount of times I go to office hours, but I notice for some of my classes that I do not have questions for my professors during office hours because they went over the material I am lost on over a week ago. I currently have a McGraw tutor in one of the classes I am not failing, but the limited amount of time does not allow me to learn the material in the way I need to actually retain it. I find it difficult to study regularly throughout the week, either I will spend 7+ hours of pomodoro method studying or I will do nothing all day. 

Has anyone else struggled this much with online learning, and is their anything I can do to  get my grades under control now? This current way of studying is unsustainable, and I am not of privilege to be able to take a gap year or defer in the future.

0.0,3.0,"Hi! I’m an UCI research assistant and I was assigned the task of understanding how major selection works in a few top colleges, one of which includes Princeton. I was wondering if you guys could help me out with a few of your opinions; it definitely doesn’t have to be objective, I’m grateful for all the information, however subjective, I can collect. I've already perused the website and statements by admission officers, but I wanted to hear from actual students, so educated guesses (or even speculation) are all appreciated!

So, here are the questions:

1. Does Princeton require you to input an intended major on your application? Can you put undeclared?
2. If Princeton does require an intended major, after you’re accepted to Princeton with that intended major, does Princeton expect you to follow through? For instance, if a student picked “Computer Science,” will Princeton funnel that student into an engineering department and expect him/her to take engineering courses and activities, or does Princeton really treat everyone the same way no matter what they picked for intended major (at least until they declare)? Is there a limiting of options in regards to classes, activities, etc. for certain majors, even unintentionally?
3. I saw that there was a deadline difference between A.B. and B.S.E degrees, with B.S.E degrees having an earlier declared major deadline. Do you think this affects major selection/major changes (or generally anything about majors) in any way?
4. When does Princeton expect students to declare their majors by? Can a student be truly “Undeclared” up until the point of declaring their majors?
5. And lastly, based on your opinion, does intended major affect admissions? A lot of colleges I’ve looked into have stated publicly that the intended major does not affect admissions, but we also know diversity in ideologies (and thus major) is also important. This, of course, is a very touchy subject and I’m definitely not expecting the absolute, objective truth for this question; just wanted to hear your thoughts.

Other than these questions, if you have any other comments you could share about how students are pressured to take certain majors over others at Princeton, and any reason they would change their major: they would be appreciated!

* How has your experience in the New Haven area been?
* Is there a ""superiority"" complex among students with regards to Harvard? That's the vibe I've gotten from admitted students chats so far.

Hey everyone! I was accepted to Yale REA and think I'll commit soon. It's my dream school and I can't see myself anywhere else. But, I wanted to see if anyone on this sub could help inform me before I make a final decision.

Firstly, I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to major in, but I know it will be in either chemistry or biology. As of now, I'm probably doing Molecular Biophysics &amp; Biochemistry. But, I have no clue what I want to do as a career, and wouldn't be surprised if I decided to switch to an Econ or Data Science/Stats major. The thing I liked about Yale was the ability to easily switch majors, I know some schools are tough since you have to transfer between colleges, but that's not the case at Yale.

Yale is also a very humanities-heavy school, but from what I've read, it's been pouring A LOT into improving its STEM programs. I don't see this as a large issue, since I enjoy humanities as much as STEM, just can't see myself majoring in anything non-STEM. The reason I didn't apply to a school like MIT is b/c I value the importance of a liberal arts education that Yale provides. Yale seems like a great school for general science (biology, physics, chem, etc. which I hope to do). It also seems like there are endless opportunities for research which interest me as well. Could anyone that's majoring in STEM talk about their experiences?

Finally, more general stuff. How's New Haven? Do you find yourself stuck in a ""Yale bubble"" or do you get the chance to explore? Do you connect with students from surrounding colleges at all?

The financial aid was great, so that’s not a concern. My family wants me to commit as well.

The “problem” (extremely good problem to have, I almost feel bad even worrying about an acceptance to YALE) is that I’m a STEM student. I don’t really know what I wanna do with my life, but I’ve gone to a STEM high school and that is more than likely what I’ll end up majoring in. I do have interests outside of math/science, and loved the idea of getting to know a variety of people in Yale residential colleges and having a liberal arts education. However, everything I’ve read says Yale isn’t that strong in STEM. 

I know at this caliber (for undergrad especially?) the distinctions of the relative strengths of the fields aren’t THAT relevant, but I keep feeling like I might be ill advised not trying for Stanford and Princeton (as a potential engineering student) even though I like Yale more... do any STEM students at Yale have something to say about the strength of stem, why you chose Yale as a stem student, etc? Also, how are the graduate school prospects in STEM from Yale, as compared to a more heavily STEM school? 

Again, I know this is dumb. Yale is amazing, fit is the most important thing, etc, etc, I’m just stressed about it and would love to hear from Yalies in this kind of situation.

I’ve only looked up one of the fun so far but it’s the index fund and it has .31% fees versus the .02% that the Vanguard fund it is replacing has. Can we *do* something?

Dear MIT 401(k) Plan Participant,

On behalf of MIT, the MIT Supplemental 401(k) Oversight Committee (“Committee”) regularly monitors and reviews the investment options offered in the 401(k) Plan. Recently, the Committee, with the guidance of its investment consultant, has decided to replace nine funds in the Plan with similar plans from the same asset classes. This fund change will occur during the evening of February 22, 2021. You are not required to take any action. The following is an explanation of the change and when it will occur. 

What Funds Will Be Changed?

The following funds will be replaced:

Current Fund to Be Eliminated	Replacement Fund

Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock U.S. Debt Income Fund F

Vanguard Total Stock Market Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock Russell 3000 Index Fund F

Vanguard Value Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Value Fund F

Vanguard Growth Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Growth Fund F

Vanguard Mid‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Mid Capitalization Equity Index Fund F

Vanguard Small‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 2000 Index Fund F

Vanguard US‐Real Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock FTSE EPRA/NARIET U.S. Index Fund F

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock MSCI ACWI ex‐U.S. IMI Index Fund F

Vanguard Emerging‐Markets Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund F

If you have invested in any of the current funds listed above, your investments will be moved automatically to the corresponding replacement fund. Your election to have future contributions invested in any of the current funds will also be automatically changed to the corresponding replacement funds. No action on your part is required.

The replacement funds are very similar to the current funds. They are of the same asset class; invest in many of the same securities; and follow a similar, though slightly different, market index. As always, we encourage all Plan participants to review their 401(k) account allocation regularly to confirm that it continues to be compatible with their retirement savings strategy.

Fact sheets for the new funds will be available in early February on the MIT Human Resources website at https://hr.mit.edu/benefits/401k and will also be posted on Fidelity’s NetBenefits website in late February.

When Is the Fund Change Happening?

The fund transfer will be made during the evening of February 22, 2021. Any fund transfers that you request before 4:00 pm EST on February 22, 2021, will be made before the current funds are replaced. Any of your investments that are automatically transferred to the new funds will be available for you to review on the Fidelity NetBenefits website after 7:00 am EST, February 23, 2021.

Why Are the Funds Being Changed?

The Committee regularly reviews the performance and fees of the investment options in the Plan. As part of this due diligence, it compared certain funds in the Plan to outside options with similar characteristics, evaluating their respective performance, index tracking variance, fund transaction costs and fund management fees. After completing its review, the Committee chose to replace the nine funds described above.

Information from Fidelity

Later this week, Fidelity will send you an announcement with detailed information about the fund changes. Please take the time to read the Fidelity announcement so you are fully informed about the changes taking place.

If you have questions, please contact the Fidelity Benefits Center at 877-648-7283 or MIT Benefits at benefits@mit.edu or 617-253-6151.

I’m also interested in the more applied side of things (rather than something like pure math research) and in particular math’s applications in the natural sciences or CS, so I’m thinking about whether a science major would be a better fit for me (or for CS I might just do 18C).

0.0,27.0,"To the members of the MIT community,

Following the Goodwin Procter report on MIT’s interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, President Reif asked that I create a process to review its findings about Professor Seth Lloyd and to identify any appropriate action. I created a two-part review and decision-making process with two faculty committees: one to review facts and determine, based on those facts, whether Professor Lloyd violated any MIT policy, and the second to recommend disciplinary action, if necessary. I write today to share the results of this intensive two-stage effort and the decision I have reached. 

Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that I am taking the unusual step of sharing this information with our entire community because of the unique public nature of the case and its impacts. Professor Lloyd knows that I am taking this step, and he understands and accepts that the outcome of this disciplinary process should be shared openly.

The Review Panel

I assembled a panel of five senior faculty leaders from across the Institute and asked them to determine if Professor Lloyd violated MIT policies. The members of the panel were Professor Rohan Abeyaratne, Institute Professor Daron Acemoglu, Institute Professor Penny Chisholm, Materials Science and Engineering Department Head Jeffrey Grossman, and Dean of Science Nergis Mavalvala (chair). The panel members reviewed the Goodwin report as well as other documents they deemed relevant and met with a number of individuals, including the Goodwin fact-finders and Professor Lloyd, several times.  

Based on this review, a majority of the members found that, in connection with donations he received from Epstein in 2012, Professor Lloyd violated MIT’s conflict of interest policy (Policies &amp; Procedures 4.4) by failing to inform MIT that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that, in doing so, he violated MIT’s policy on faculty misconduct (Policies &amp; Procedures 3.4.2). A minority of the members could not conclude one way or the other that his actions violated the conflict of interest policy. 

The full panel further determined that he did not violate any MIT policies in accepting a gift from Epstein in 2005–2006 and a donation in 2017. The panel members did not find that Professor Lloyd tried to circumvent the MIT vetting process nor that he sought to conceal the name of the donor. They did conclude, however, that he failed to reveal crucial information about Epstein’s background to anyone at MIT.

The Evaluation Committee

The panel submitted its findings to a separate evaluation committee consisting of Dean of Engineering Anantha Chandrakasan, Mechanical Engineering Department Head Evelyn Wang, Physics Department Head Peter Fisher, Mechanical Engineering Associate Department Head Pierre Lermusiaux, and Faculty Chair Rick Danheiser. The evaluation committee convened several times, including meetings with the review panel members and with Professor Lloyd. Based on the panel’s conclusions, the evaluation committee recommended a set of disciplinary actions, which they stated ""focused on Professor Lloyd’s poor judgment and the impact of his actions on the community, which he may not have yet fully appreciated.""

My Decision

After conferring with senior administrative and faculty leaders, as well as the two committees, I have decided to implement the recommended disciplinary actions. 

For a period of five years, a set of disciplinary actions will limit Professor Lloyd’s compensation, his ability to engage in solicitation of donors and foundations, and his involvement in first-year undergraduate advising, and will impose several other restrictions on normal privileges accorded to a faculty member. In addition, Professor Lloyd will be expected to undergo training on professional conduct before resuming certain activities on campus, including teaching. 

These steps cannot undo the harm done. Professor Lloyd’s failure to share what he knew about Epstein’s conviction when he accepted his 2012 donations was unacceptable. His interactions with Epstein and certain of his actions surrounding acceptance of the donations serve to highlight the importance of the current Institute-wide effort to develop clearer guidelines for engaging with donors. 

I recognize that many in our community remain deeply disturbed by the interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and that some will be disappointed by this decision. In addition, for some, this outcome may renew past pain. If you feel you would benefit from support or guidance at this time, you can find a range of resources here.

I would like to close by extending my gratitude to the entire MIT community for your engagement, your candor, and your care for MIT.

there is also the side factor that these units would have been in classes that all felt pretty meaningless/purposeless, which may have been why i felt so much less motivation than on campus. also, i am doing way more extracurriculars this year.

so why does e-school feel like so much more awful than in-person school? does anyone else feel this way?

To say that I am disappointed by the lack of solidarity from the Stanford community, would be an understatement.

I implore you to think about our equal moral worth as human beings, and more than that, about our shared claim to the Stanford experience. Have we not all studied in Green Library, snuck onto the roof at MemChu, ate a delicious hot dog at Caspar dining? Does this mean nothing to you?

The vitriol and anger currently circulating will engender harrowing consequences for our institution and for the free market system. If left unchecked, I fear this company’s IPO may be blocked, and they could even face delinquency. Need I remind you of how Stanford has [fallen so drastically short](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ps2PNZh) in recent global metrics?

Although I'd appreciate any advice or comments, soliciting them isn't my intention.

I'm currently living on campus with my friends. I love them all; they're incredibly chill, full of energy and fun to be around. But as an international student, I feel out of place. There are so many references that go over my head, like the cartoons and TV shows they watched growing up, the music hits of middle school and vines that I've never been exposed to. It feels really hard to relate or contribute to conversations. Often, I feel like I have no opinions about things. My friends would debate which Miley Cyrus song is the best banger or which Disney channel actor/actress turned to be the hottest as they grew up. I've never really thought about those things, and don't understand the circumstances that would force one to, yet my friends seem to have immediate strong opinions about these things and have come up with lines of reasoning explaining their positions. Coupled with the fact that half the time I don't know what they're debating, it always feels like I'm just an observer in the friend group. I feel like they forget I exist, and by extension I feel like an outsider.

It doesn't help that I already have issues with active listening, vocabulary recall or expressing myself on the spot. English is not my first language, and I've only been conversing in it for a few years. This is also exacerbated by the fact that 18 years of living with a manipulative, hot-tempered mom has taught me to be agreeable and actively seek to please the people around me. I often just nod, smile or laugh, not knowing what for. These reflexes seem to be programmed in me. Whenever I try to overcome them, try to be true to myself, I'm hit with self-worth issues. Nothing about my life, at least to me, seems worth sharing. I don't have any funny anecdotes, while my friends always seem to have something funny that's happened to them recently. Adding to that, I hate my body, every bit of it. Although I know that my friends don't view my as ugly per se, they always throw around the word ""fat"" negatively. It makes me question if that connotation carries in the way the see me.

Perhaps the only time where I'm truly able to be ""me"", is when I'm drunk or high. So whenever I have the chance to, I always get really drunk, and try to get everyone around me to be drunk. It's the only time where I know I have an excuse if I say something that people would conventionally deem stupid or of no value to the conversation. Heck, my friends would just laugh because they're drunk. It's the only time where I can say the word ""like"" six times in the same sentence because I don't know what the English word for the specific thing I'm trying to describe is. People would think I'm just too drunk, that I'm not dumb. This has been very unhealthy because drinking alcohol or smoking weed seem to ruin my mood for the next few days.

So, even though I'm surrounded by people I love and admire, who I know I can count on, I feel alone. I don't know how I'd ever bring this up to them. Hell, saying this makes me question if they really see me as a friend or they just keep me around because I'm a ""generally nice person"". And the thing is, I know they're good people, but I also know that they wouldn't know how to respond or act if I ever told them this. I don't even know how to begin expressing myself, like would I call a ""friend group meeting"" and put myself under the spotlight? That just seems too dramatic. Even if I manage to do that, I know the moment I start to speak, my entire vocabulary will just disappear, my thoughts and feelings will no longer feel valid or worth listening to. I can't bear the feeling of making anyone feel even a little bit bad or sad. My whole life prior to Stanford was walking on egg shells trying not to trigger my mom, not to have her throw shit and break shit, not to hear her scream and stop talking to me for days on end.

All of these things, and many other things, compounded with school work and fucking PWR2 (that seems to incorporate even more work than a normal year would have) serves only to fuel sixty different voices in my head that I have no control over. I can't stop thinking. I can't stop hating myself, hating the circumstances that made me the way I am, hating every piece of my existence. Closing my eyes, and imagining my existence melt away is the only thing that brings me peace. I don't know what to do with myself. I've been trying so hard, but there's very little left in me. I'm depleted.

I'll be applying to the ICME masters program next year, and I am looking for advice on whether I should apply to the data science vs. computational finance track. I am a CS/Stats major with SWE internships, so my profile is much more suited for the data science track. However, I am seeking a masters because I want to transition into quant finance, so my top choice is comp. finance, but I have 0 prior internships in finance.

Some questions I have are:

1. Which track should I apply to, given that (i) my top choice is the finance track, (ii) I have no finance work experience, and (iii) my profile is much more relevant for data science?
2. Is it possible to switch tracks once you're in the program? If so, I am thinking it might be a good idea to apply to data science, but I've also heard there are far more applicants for DS than there are for finance, so I might have better chances applying to finance in this case.

So, I'm using my AP Spanish test for the language requirement, and am thinking of taking AP Biology (4,5), AP Statistics (5), AP Calculus BC (4,5\*), and AP Physics C: Mechanics (5).                                                                 \* ^(I probably need a 5 for the 18000 math sequence)

My school does not offer AP Physics C: Mechanics, so I'm currently trying to self-study for it (in a semester), so I wanted to ask if any of you recommend I take it at UChicago instead (so that I can discard it totally from my list since self-studying leaves many gaps in understanding &amp; is just overwhelming to do it simultaneously with my Calc self-study.... while having a bunch of other things to do in school and at home....not me venting :-|).

The Bio, Stats, Calc, and Spanish credit look, overall, more helpful. But, I was starting to think about dropping the Calc BC to take the Physics C, to only depend on the placement test (which I was advised by some of you is not ideal to place into the 18000s). So, Physics C is the problem right now...

0.0,23.0,"I think it's hilarious how the same people who would've been frothing at the mouths about boys rating girls with ""shots"" (even just for over the sexualization part, not to mention the equating of getting drunk and consenting to sex) either are ignoring the OAX incident or gave just a few tight-lipped comments because their friends were involved. It just seems ironic, considering that no small portion of the people now silent were the ones most aggressively pestering kids in our class when the celebration screenshots came out. It seems that personal opinions are coloring the social/political positions being held, which, I guess when you think about it, isn't actually that surprising. Of course, for the people who are staying consistent to ""holding people accountable,"" good on you.

Now, I don't think there's any point in dragging this whole affair with the slideshow out longer. Was the powerpoint mean? Of course it was, and I hope those in it (who aren't taking it lightly, because, fair enough, even if personally I find the situation pretty humorous, I can see how it would be significantly less humorous if I was in it) realize the irrelevancy of the opinions of the idiot kids who made it and aren't hit too hard by it.

Still, I don't think there's any benefit to hounding the makers of the powerpoint. Won't achieve much, most likely. Plus, forgive and forget and all that stuff. Not just here, but in general. (But stop blaming /r/UPenn for making shit that was obviously not created here. I mean, seriously, that's a four year old's excuse. If you're not going to own up to it like an adult, at least put a better effort into pretending you didn't make it.)

But I find the occasional claims in defense of the slideshow-makers that there should be restraint *out of concern* for those responsible somewhat ironic (even if I think there's no point in retaliating or pursuing the case further), considering how little concern there was for the mental state of certain individuals in our class before. Then, it was ""he doesn't get to claim mental health as an excuse for his problematic behavior;"" now, it's too often ""let's not be too hasty in casting judgment,"" or simply radio silence.",UPenn,Some thoughts on the OAX situation,23.0,0.7

Up until now I had been collecting spit and I had exactly 2mL in my mouth at this point.

Although it was clearly stated in the syllabus and at the top of the quiz that calculators were not allowed, I did this because the question asked for a numerical answer and that you might not be able to give a decimal answer without a calculator. I misinterpreted this as permission to use a calculator on the last step of the integral instead of just plugging in the bounds and simplifying.

Now I have a 0% on this quiz and cannot replace it with the redo, which means that my final grade potential is lowered 7%.

* What's the exchange student experience like in general? Does anyone know any past exchange students I could get in contact with?

I'm now considering moving my JHU app to RD, as I would be committed to pay full tuition (70k/year) if accepted to Hopkins with EDII.

AMS on the other hand is a tried and true path that has seen thousands of graduates receive their degrees and go on to be highly successful. Though perhaps it lacks more practical skills such as programming that the Data Science degree does a better job of covering.

0.0,0.0,"Hi all,

So as I’m sure many people have noticed, we have very harsh restrictions (no people in your room, no sitting in hallways, no common areas for now, mask mandate when running alone outside, etc). These rules are obviously sparking mental health issues in many freshmen. However, I don’t really want to argue about whether they are fully justified or not right now; I understand that we have a responsibility to protect the Baltimore community. My concern is for later in the semester and looking forward to the fall.

By some point in mid March, a year after all of this really started, the vast majority of healthcare workers and elderly will have had the opportunity to receive the vaccine. This is amazing, because the vaccine so far seems to be 95% effective at preventing illness but 100% effective at preventing hospitalization. Since the vast majority of deaths (I believe 80%+, but correct me if I’m wrong) have occurred in people over the age of 65, this will reduce to death rate to be on par with a seasonal flu. On top of that, overall transmission rates will be cut as we slowly approach the heard immunity threshold.

However, because college aged students are incredibly low risk (I believe that death rate for people under 20 is .003%) we are dead last in line for the vaccine. This makes sense, if we want to reduce deaths then we need to prioritize vaccinating people who actually could die if they catch the virus. HOWEVER, it is not justified, fair, or reasonable for Johns Hopkins, or society as a whole, to continue imposing restrictions on healthy young people when the people we have been protecting for the last year are no longer vulnerable. 

The school has said the restrictions will likely remain in place for the entire semester. This is not based on actual science or data, nor is it good public health policy. Good policy takes into account more than one disease, and at this rate the risk of student suicide is likely much higher than the risk of a student COVID death. We did not have mask mandates, lockdowns, capacity restrictions, etc. for the flu, which is more dangerous to our demographic than COVID is. Therefore, it does not make any sense to continue with restrictions when COVID death rates reach the flu’s (~60k per year).

I am very concerned that the university has dug a hole that will be very difficult to crawl out of without a sensible, set in stone reopening metric. COVID zero, and even full student vaccination, are not reasonable levels to hope for before allowing a semblance of normal. I really hope everyone understands my concern and what I’m trying to say here.",jhu,COVID Restrictions after March,0.0,0.35

I know normally he isn't that great of a prof but I was wondering if anyone who had him last semester or heard friends talk about him last semester could comment on how he did. 

It seems that his grading schemes (midterms only worth 15%, final only 20%)  and style were drastically changed for the online environment, so  I was wondering if it was as bad with him as in previous semesters or a little bit better.

I don’t  want this to come off rude in anyway, but this situation has really left me feeling unwelcome in clubs. I am in 2 specific clubs where the other members stop speak english once the white members leave meetings.

It is clear that I do not speak this language, but they carry on the meetings without speaking english then I am uninformed on things and I don’t  want to ask them to stop because I am outnumbered and don’t  want micro aggressions in other orgs they may be on the board of. There are essentially no other people that share my background in 95% of these clubs so I cant afford to have people upset at me when I try to join others.

What should I do?

EDIT: I have nothing against the language
