I'm in my first year as a freshman business student at a small college. I want to be careful about the courses that I'm taking this semester, so I'll have the opportunity to apply to Wharton as a transfer student later.

Would you please let me know what courses are important to take? Are macro, micro, and calculus the only necessary requirements?

1612486893.0,0.0,20.0,"I think it's hilarious how the same people who would've been frothing at the mouths about boys rating girls with ""shots"" (even just for over the sexualization part, not to mention the equating of getting drunk and consenting to sex) either are ignoring the OAX incident or gave just a few tight-lipped comments because their friends were involved. It just seems ironic, considering that no small portion of the people now silent were the ones most aggressively pestering kids in our class when the celebration screenshots came out. It seems that personal opinions are coloring the social/political positions being held, which, I guess when you think about it, isn't actually that surprising. Of course, for the people who are staying consistent to ""holding people accountable,"" good on you.

Now, I don't think there's any point in dragging this whole affair with the slideshow out longer. Was the powerpoint mean? Of course it was, and I hope those in it (who aren't taking it lightly, because, fair enough, even if personally I find the situation pretty humorous, I can see how it would be significantly less humorous if I was in it) realize the irrelevancy of the opinions of the idiot kids who made it and aren't hit too hard by it.

Still, I don't think there's any benefit to hounding the makers of the powerpoint. Won't achieve much, most likely. Plus, forgive and forget and all that stuff. Not just here, but in general. (But stop blaming /r/UPenn for making shit that was obviously not created here. I mean, seriously, that's a four year old's excuse. If you're not going to own up to it like an adult, at least put a better effort into pretending you didn't make it.)

But I find the occasional claims in defense of the slideshow-makers that there should be restraint *out of concern* for those responsible somewhat ironic (even if I think there's no point in retaliating or pursuing the case further), considering how little concern there was for the mental state of certain individuals in our class before. Then, it was ""he doesn't get to claim mental health as an excuse for his problematic behavior;"" now, it's too often ""let's not be too hasty in casting judgment,"" or simply radio silence.",UPenn,Some thoughts on the OAX situation,20.0,0.69

Although it was clearly stated in the syllabus and at the top of the quiz that calculators were not allowed, I did this because the question asked for a numerical answer and that you might not be able to give a decimal answer without a calculator. I misinterpreted this as permission to use a calculator on the last step of the integral instead of just plugging in the bounds and simplifying.

I am part of the University of Pennsylvania Occupational Medicine Residency program and we are conducting an online study trying to learn more about COVID-19 PPE availability and perceptions and burnout. We are an IRB approved study and are not collecting any personally identifying information. We are trying to include feedback from many different groups within the medical community so we can better understand PPE availability nationwide as well as how this is impacting healthcare professionals and things like burnout.

If you work in healthcare and have a few minutes to help, please take our survey. If you don’t work in healthcare but know somebody who does, please feel free to share this study with them. We are hoping the results from this study can lead to improvements in future policies.

1611465470.0,0.0,35.0,"Here is an overly complicated tutorial on how to set up you android home screen to automatically display your most recent PennOpenPass pass:

1. Make sure that the phone which you're using is receiving text messages whenever you get a new pass. You need to add your phone number on PennOpenPass, and maybe sign up for text reminders.
2. Go to the Play Store and download SMS Forwarder (see link in comments). Set up a filter in it as follows (leave all other settings in their default state):
   1. `Email or phone number`: Set this to any **gmail** address you have access to. We're going to be sending messages to it every time you get a new PennOpenPass pass, so choose an address where that won't bother you. Feel free to make a new email just for this, it takes like 2 minutes. For the sake of this tutorial, let's say you choose the email `name@example.com`
   2. `From who`: Set this to `+12672230163`. This is the number PennOpenPass uses to send notifications.
   3. `Rule for text`: Set this to `You have a`
   4. `Email subject`: Set this to `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass`
3. Fill out a PennOpenPass symptom check. You can do this even if you already completed one today. If we've set up everything correctly, you should receive an email with the subject `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass` which contains a link to your new pass.
4. Create a Rebrandly account (see link in comments) and create a link. We're going to set this link up to always forward to the link of your most recent pass. It doesn't matter what you set the destination to for now, just put google.com or something. You can set the link address to whatever you want, for the sake of this tutorial let's say you call the link `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`
5. Create a Zapier account (see link in comments) and create a new Zap, which should be set up as follows:
   1. In the `Gmail` option: `Trigger: New Email Matching Search in Gmail`, with the search set to `subject:([SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass)`. Make sure the email account you're using is the same one you're using with SMS Forwarder.
   2. In the `Formatter by Zapier` option: `Action: Text`, set to `Extract URL` from `Body Plain` (the body of the email)
   3. In the `Rebrandly` option: `Action: Update Branded Link in Rebrandly`, with the `Destination URL` set to the URL extracted in the previous step, and the `Link` set to the custom link you made earlier, in this case `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`.
6. Download Widgery (see link in comments) and create a new widget, whose `Web Address` is the custom link you made, `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`. You may also want to change some other settings, like turning on `When clicking on widget this will refresh the image` and `Image the same size as the widget` under `Advanced Settings`. Add the widget to your home screen (how you do this varies by device).

And we're done. If everything is working properly, every time you fill out a symptom check and get a new PennOpenPass pass, it will automatically be displayed inside the widget on your home screen (you will need to tap on the widget once to refresh it). I've only just set this up myself, so there may be some bugs to resolve, but it seems to be working pretty well.

1611358870.0,0.0,29.0,"Hi everyone. So, with people coming back on campus and Penn’s policies around quiet periods etc, the subreddit has been the place for a lot of discussion around COVID-related topics. Unfortunately, comment sections and posts are becoming more and more heated. In fact, we’ve had to ban more users in the past two weeks than we have in the entire prior year. 

  
Going forward, we want to remind members of our general stance towards comments and posts and outline our general process around deciding what content is appropriate vs. not appropriate for the subreddit.  


1. **Please remember to be respectful.** Calling people “lame”, “losers”, “narcs” etc or wishing ill will upon them is not the way to engage in respectful discussion with others. Those comments will be hit with a removal. Repeated comments of that nature will be hit with a ban. \[This falls directly under rule #1 of the subreddit. Unfortunately, this has also been the rule that has been violated the most as of late.\]
2. **Don’t engage with the troll.** For users that have a repeated history of engaging in spreading misinformation (e.g. “covid isn’t a big deal” “students won’t get complications” “it’s just a party bro”, etc), don’t engage with them. Just point it out to the mods and we’ll see if a ban is warranted. Ways to spot a troll: usually the #1 indicator is that they have no real history of going here. Other ways = them continuing to spout misinformation despite individuals attempting to convince them otherwise. Please use the report button if you suspect someone is a troll. \[This more or less falls under rules #1 and #5\].
3. **Don’t post identifying information.** In line with reddit policy around doxxing, please refrain from posting information about addresses, locations, etc. For the individuals who are posting about parties happening, **PLEASE** approach penn about it first ([https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl](https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl) or talk to your RA). If you do feel a burning desire to post, think about redacting specific identifying information. If someone could figure it out with a couple of google searches and having a few mutual friends with the people of interest, that information should probably be shared with penn instead of the internet.
4. **Do engage in discussion with those who have genuine questions about covid.** The #1 thing I’ve seen in my MPH program is that change in people's attitudes really does happen at the individual level. If you see someone asking whether something is true or not related to covid, engage respectfully with them in the comments if you believe they’re asking in good faith. Remember, all of you are a part of a community of thousands of individuals working at Penn. It is **everyone’s** responsibility to be on board with covid guidelines so we can protect those who are most vulnerable. Accordingly, do y’alls best to convert those who are doubtful, but also recognize when a discussion is not grounded in good-faith and should probably be left alone.",UPenn,FYI on COVID related mod stuff,29.0,0.94

I though it was pretty weird as I never got a question like this from a professor before but I didn’t pay much attention too it. But right after their question, they mentioned how they just finished listening to whole lotta red by playboi carti and how it was a classic. At first, I thought it was a joke and chuckled. However, I realized they were serious when they started playing the album in class. I was so in shock I immediately left zoom.

My name is Nour Azhari and I'm a Clinical Psychology graduate from Columbia University. I am working on a research initiative to better understand **mental health on college campuses in the US**in order to develop new services that would meet those needs.

We are currently speaking to college students/recent grads who have either:

* Been referred out of their school counseling center
* Put on their center's waitlist (had to wait before your first session)

If you are one of those students, would you be open to speaking to us briefly for about 20 mins in the next few weeks? I would so appreciate your perspective, wisdom, and experience to help guide our efforts.

If you are willing to help us, please let me know what times work with you by directly scheduling a call with us: [https://calendly.com/greblernoam/mental-health-in-college-campuses](https://calendly.com/greblernoam/mental-health-in-college-campuses)

One of my top reasons for that is because I want to jump right into PA school from undergrad, but that is very rare. Another reason, is that I would have to be working a substantial amount of hours to get healthcare experience during undergrad. Thus, I believe that transferring internally to the School of Nursing would be a feasible option. If I were to become a PA, chances are I would be taking 1-2 gap years, and that is something I don't want to do. 

1. NP and PA are very similar professions (PAs have lateral mobility, but I am looking to work in general pediatrics/urgent cares/emergency medicine). A family nurse practitioner can do all of that. 
2. If I get a BSN, RN, I would have job security after undergrad (work for 1 year and gain experience and apply to NP school, or I can apply straight out of undergrad).

1610257911.0,0.0,14.0,"Hello hello! Off-campus housing planning for the 2021-2022 academic year is somewhat beginning to get underway. For personal use of myself and some friends planning to go off campus, I found a spreadsheet template first developed by [u/Pianoplunkster](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pianoplunkster/) at UC Davis ([original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/3wpbgy/i_made_a_spreadsheet_template_to_help_you/)) from a while back and got to work. I've included all of the original user's tips available on the second tab, as well as made some of my own immediately relevant to Penn FinAid recipients. 

I've made some minor edits to the spreadsheet itself as well as formatted it as a table to allow for easier sorting. Perhaps the most significant edit is a cost-calculator (affectionately named ""Matthew's \~ Off-Campus, Cost-Cutting Calculator Extravaganza© \~""). It provides a month-by-month assessment of the total costs of living off-campus according to the assumptions laid out to the right and is affected by changing the values of marked cells to fit your housing estimates and predictions. Some notes are added to explain some of the formulas; the only thing I would add beyond what the spreadsheet already says is that ""realization of financial aid"" can come in the form of a bigger refund (for highly aided students) or just less money paid to the University (for moderately aided students). Either way, the effect is realized when Penn handles billing in September and January.

Important disclaimers: I am a current Sophomore and thus experienced with financial aid, but in NO WAY a hardened veteran of the system. I am personally confident enough in my formulas and estimates that they are useful to me, but I am still a mere mortal and cannot guarantee the calculator will be an effective forecast, particularly if Covid remains a force in the way Penn handles FinAid when September rolls around. I recommend you personally verify any estimates yielded with your financial aid counselor. All of that said, if you find any inaccuracies or problems with the template please feel more than free to comment below and I'll try to make edits to the sheet ASAP for my benefit and to avoid misinformation.

You can find a viewable version of the spreadsheet template [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQdNyUjSPZ9QQrUP8cS6GDCAAJX7hW6n/view?usp=sharing).

The new app is intended to be a helpful mental health resource. In the future it will be used for patients in therapy, but right now we are opening it up to college undergrads for research purposes. 

**The study is 1 month long and involves a total compensation of $50. This is broken down into $15 after week 1, $15 after week 3, and $20 at the end of the study.**

The basic layout of the study is as follows:

\- you would complete the informed consent and enrollment process on the secure RedCap platform

\- you would attend a short (&lt; 30min) webinar where a researcher would explain how the app works

\- for 28 days you would complete a 11 question daily survey (should take less than 5 min each day)

\- every other week you would complete a longer bi-weekly survey (and get paid after these)

\- at the end of the study you would receive a final payment. 

**If you are interested, please follow the RedCap link below to enroll. This will lead you to the informed consent where you can find out more information about the study.**

I spent my first two years at Penn struggling with depression and a serious eating disorder so I was never able to apply myself enough to join clubs or have a real social life. I spent junior year in therapy and by Spring 2020 I finally felt like myself again. I joined some clubs and felt like things were going to be okay. Then covid happened. I still felt hopeful because I thought senior year would be the year where I came into myself and would be able to apply everything I had learned to have a great year and graduate feeling proud of my college experience. I truly believe my senior year would have been amazing and made up for the disappointing college years that came before.

Instead I've been stuck in an abusive home environment for a year and will be graduating with very little to show for my college experience. I am so sad that my year will be the only Penn class to have never gotten hey day, feb club, and we possibly won't get graduation either. I had saved so many interesting classes to take my senior year and now I'm having to take them online, which I have a really hard time staying engaged with. I learned almost nothing this past semester online even though I'm taking the most important classes of my major. It makes me incredibly sad that I will never again experience an in person lecture or study in our libraries again. I'll never be able to go to Smokes. All the things that make college worth it, completely stripped. My personal, social, and academic life have all taken serious hits and I don't have another year of college to make up for it.

I guess this is just a post venting about covid and senior year but also I wanted to know if other seniors are experiencing this? No one is talking about it. It felt like the whole world felt bad for the Class of 2020 because they missed two months of college but the Class of 2021 is missing our last 1.5 years of college.

I am currently an undergraduate freshman and I honestly found CIS110 to be one of the least enjoyable classes I have ever taken in my life. I did some coding with Python in HS and thought the transition to Java wouldn't be so bad, especially since this course is branded as an introductory course.

The first few weeks weren't too bad and I felt like I was enjoying using Java. However, then came objects and it was right around the pass/fail deadline. I was hesitant about changing to pass/fail because I thought it was just the objects week that was going to be hard for me and because I plan to major in math where computer science can often times be important. However, that turned out to be a huge mistake. Ever since objects, my performance in the course plummeted. Trying to understand stuff from office hours and Piazza just took too much time and kept falling behind.

What absolutely sucks about this course is that they don't let you use any outside help. Whenever I couldn't understand stuff for a course in high school, I would just get a tutor, but they don't permit that here. Therefore, if you don't like the teaching style, you are screwed. It also just means your questions will take longer to be answered, which is incredibly inefficient. I talked to some older students from other universities who have taken computer science and they said their courses allow searching stuff up as long as you don't plagiarize stuff. I get that CIS110 is the university's course and not another university's, but the justification feel disingenuous to me. Them saying that StackExchange/Yahoo answers ""will likely be snarky, irrelevant to the assignment, or detrimental to the learning goals of the assignment,"" in my view, is an utterly contrived and dishonest reason.

I ended up with a D in this course. I am so upset at myself. I wasn't able to complete any of homework after the objects week because it got way too hard. I couldn't make any non-trivial progress on the final project. It didn't help that the homework was so project-based about material you just learned. I get that real life computer science is about projects but that's the phase where you are applying and should be more experience. At the learning phase, going to the deep end so suddenly throws me off.

I hate this. I hate how the stars all misaligned against me to screw me over. I hate how this course is so one-dimensional. I hate how this D is stuck on my transcript.

Also the final grade distribution is not going to be published, which also seems sketchy to me.

I'm a freshman thinking of transferring to Penn. I have a random question. In group projects, especially in Wharton, are there people who don't care or don't do any work, then someone ends up doing most of the work? I have always been that person that does most of the work. Also, I like to be creative with projects and go above and beyond. So, I was curious about Penn's group project atmosphere and whether it's any different from what I described initially. I understand that there will always be different types of students, and I have definitely encountered some hardworking ones.

""I've been spending the last two days grading the final. I'm actually almost done. One thing that happens when you grade 96 finals back to back is that you start to notice trends. In particular when people get the same weird (and wrong) answer, have gibberish and then the correct answer, or just do the problem in a style that is a bit off.

Well - it turns out that most of the exam is up on Chegg. It might not surprise you that two of the solutions are wrong (!) (you get what you pay for). Needless to say, it is pretty straightforward for me to identify patterns whether they came from Chegg or your friend.

Once I bump this up to the University, it is out of my hands. If do bump it up to the University, I will follow through on my promise about your future. I have seen the future, and it is not good.

On the other hand, you can come clean *right now*. Not tomorrow, not after I send you a personal email - now. In other words I have already identified a few exams. So, you should consider yourself already caught. Do yourself a favor and minimize the damage by contacting me. This goes for anyone who *knows* anyone who cheated. You can contact me and I will make sure it remains anonymous. If you are in that grey area where you gave your answer to, or helped someone - If I find out, you both go down. If you let me know and make your case, it will be easier for you.

You have until Noon ET December 27th. 

To the vast, vast majority of you who worked so very hard this semester, I really do hope you have a great break! It will be a bit hard for me to assign grades until I work this out, but I will get it the process started. Sorry about that!

Assuming, rent and average utilities is 1000, I'd pay ~5000 upfront.

 Given that I'm highly aided and would expect to receive a refund for housing and dining of around 14k in September, that would mean I'd have around 9000 left over (if I were to deduct the costs I paid using my own money) for rent from September to around April (given that my last months rent is covered and the security deposit covers another month), I would have around 2000 left. 

I haven't even included the cost of food yet or unexpectedly high utilities, so in reality, I don't see how I'd be saving money or getting pocket money with refunds. 

I'd love to have more freedom, especially going into next fall but at this point the cost of living seems concerning. If I were to stay on campus I'd basically get a 4000~5000 refund for meals, which is more than anyone really needs so financially, I'd be saving more actually staying on campus. 

However, it would be annoying given that I'd most likely be stuck around a bunch of sophomores in the highrises as an upperclassmen, but since I do have a little seniority in the housing process, I could possibly get a single apartment.

A Q&amp;A thread for admitted students will be posted in the sub after results have come out.

Good luck to all those waiting for their decisions!

**To those that were rejected:** So sorry. College admissions is a crapshoot, and you should not determine your worth by this decision. I know that's easier said than done. I was in your shoes over a decade ago when I got rejected from my dream school. The tears and anger will subside, and as long as you don't let the rejection linger over you...you can make the best out of where you will end up and have a wonderful life. 11 years later, I'm thrilled I didn't get into my first choice.

Also you can’t eat or drink anything for 30 minutes before the test, otherwise they said it would come out inconclusive. I just feel like that’s gonna be really hard for undergrads to follow, especially because I’ve seen how hard it’s been to get anyone to follow any basic health instructions/inconveniences this semester (speaking as an undergrad myself).
