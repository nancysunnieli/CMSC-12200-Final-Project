I'm an incoming law student this fall and wanted to get a sanity check from all of u Cambridge veterans. I'm sorry for the vague and nooby nature of these questions, but I've never actually hunted for apartments or even dorms.

Seeing the rent rates in Cambridge coming from a mid-size Midwestern city is quite jarring; is $2000+ really a fair rate throughout Cambridge for a studio apartment? Is Harvard University Housing (HUH) a good route to go, or would I be better off looking at other private landlords? Or, even further, is my best bet just getting on-campus housing? Are there any Harvard-specific peculiarities in the housing process I should be aware of? If any of you are from the Midwest, what would you recommend for me to look out for in terms of particularly drastic changes in lifestyle/climate?

Also, while I'm here I figure I'll ask, even though no one possibly has an answer: what's you guys' ascertainment of the administration's attitude towards potentially returning to campus this fall? I go to a large state school that never really vacated campus except for the tail-end of spring 2020 (i.e. students are still living on campus and going to physical, albeit altered/hybrid classes), but I understand that Harvard's approach has been more cautious. Just wondering if there's any word on the street.

We would like to open up a discussion about Rule 2 of the sub. This is a checkup to make sure it reflects the needs and desires of this subreddit. This isn't in response to a particular event; this is just something we have come across several times and I figure it would be best to just let everyone discuss it and come to a consensus (if that's not too optimistic). 

As of this post, rule 2 is:

&gt; 2) No advertising or soliciting non-Harvard sponsored products, apps, surveys, or other materials.*
&gt; 
&gt; *: Special arrangements can be made to advertise officially recognized events and organizations directly related to Harvard subject to moderator approval. Contact the moderators directly to inquire.
&gt; 

This rule is meant to filter posts that advertise things.

The wording and conditions of Rule 2 have changed slightly over the years; for a while it was just ""No advertising or soliciting""; then we added ""of non-Harvard sponsored ...""; then we added the asterisk. The original intent of the rule was to filter out spammy posts advertising because of the subreddit's name and reputation. However, there are of course legitimate things to advertise so we had to figure out how to best draw the line, hence all the changes. 

---

As it stands, the current rule requires that any person or organization not officially recognized by the University seek moderator approval before advertising an event, service, opportunity, etc. There have been plenty of queries that we've denied, but there have been some that we have approved. The MO for our decision-making is: ""is this advertisement useful, relevant, and legitimate?"" For example, the [Jeopardy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/jo2g8j/the_jeopardy_national_college_championship/) post was useful, relevant, and legitimate. However, there are some advertisements that we don't think meet those criteria (e.g. a high school tutoring company seeking to hire Harvard student tutors). We believe something like that crosses the line into spam and/or reputation-seeking. 

Please chime in below with your thoughts on the current rule, and if there are any changes or tweaks you would like to see. For example, do you agree with the two instances I gave above?

5 course route:

\- LS50b (counts as two courses)

\- Spanish 50

\- Expos 20 (unsure of which one yet)

\- Either Psych 16 (Developmental Psychology) or Psych 2485 (Bad Genes, Bad Parents, Bad Behavior - criminality and psychopathy class)

6 course route: 

\- Same as above but I would take both Psych 16 and Psych 2485 instead of choosing between the two. 

For context, this past semester I took LS50a, Psych 18 (Abnormal Psychology), and Spanish 40. Initially, I wasn't planning on taking Psych 2485, but since it'll be Buckholtz's last semester at Harvard, I really wanted to take another class with them since they were a phenomenal professor in Psych 18 and they made psychopathy sound like a really cool topic to study. However, I also really want to do Psych 16 next semester and so I'm torn and don't really want to have to make a choice between the two (especially since my 4 year plan is looking super packed already and I don't want to delay Psych 16).

I get that there are a limits on the number of beds on campus and that administration wants to maintain some sense of normalcy with live lectures, but you also think they could stop and consider that a massive group of students on the west coast are being fucked over. Stop doing lip service to the idea that you care about time zone difficulties when you are disadvantaging every student who lives on the west coast.

Is it true? Do you really do that or our folks just think that by taking our devices they can make us feel cool?

0.0,1604950570.0,22.0,Harvard,"Hi Harvard folk,

I was introduced to my ancestry this summer and I came to learn many interesting things, one of which being that there was a lineage of Harvard and Yale graduates. This was indeed a long time ago; the first of my ancestors to graduate Harvard was in 1693, followed by two of his sons in 1722 and 1725, and one graduating Yale in 1735. In addition, there was also a very close association between my family and the first overseer of Harvard that spans from the founding of the college in 1636. I came to discover this information through various published accounts of New England's history.

My ancestors later emigrated and founded a town in Canada sometime amidst the American Revolution. Growing up, no one in my family ever taught me about the storyline of our ancestry. I suspect that they, for the most part, had no knowledge of any of this. My family did and still does have traditions around being loyal Bruins and Red Sox fans, although for reasons they never quite knew why.

While I am not looking to be admitted into either of these schools, I was wondering what legacy implications there could be for my children in the future if they were to choose to pursue studies at either of these institutions. When one declares legacy, is there space to expand on such lineage or is it simply a yes/no box that's ticked? Is legacy only valid if it is related to the school that one's parent(s) attended?

Hoping to receive some perspective on this matter from the current Harvard community.

I'm currently casting the all-new competition featuring 15 colleges from across the country and I'd love Harvard to be one of those schools. The Jeopardy! National College Championship promises to be a competition like you've never seen before. Think NCAA tournament, but Jeopardy!

I'm in touch with a couple of folks at the school including JR Bagley in the Dean of Students Office who's going to help me get the word out through his channels, but I wanted to share the info here with you as well. 

The first step is taking the test, the link to which is below. You guys should set aside at least 15 minutes to complete it. We'd love for you to take it ideally by Saturday 11/21. Once you do so we'll reach out and let you know next steps if the producers choose to move you forward.

How on earth do I cope with the constant rejection at this school?

Clubs? Rejected. 
Volunteer programs? Rejected. 
Internships? Rejected.
Grants? Rejected. 

I put hours into my applications for things and I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m starting to get tired of working hard in school and other areas of my life when things keep turning out so shitty. It’s really hard when I’ve been at this school for over a year and everyone I know has at least found a place on campus but I just keep getting rejected. People are already talking about internships they have lined up for the spring or the summer and I really need the money from a spring internship or something, but I keep getting rejected from things. 

I’ve tried research assistantships but I get rejected from those too. After over a year at Harvard, I’m really fucking tired of the rejection and it genuinely feels like I was accepted as a big joke so that they could have someone that other students could compare themselves to when they were feeling down. 

I’ve tried CAMHS too and when they had me wait for over a month to be seen, that felt like another rejection. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m sort of spiraling and I feel like I need something to go right, even something small so I can feel like life is worth living again and that I haven’t damned myself to 4 yrs of misery at Harvard, but I can’t find that thing.

Was just wondering if anyone could provide insight into GSAS life (like maybe how you guys found it different from undergrad, socially and academically) or the MS CSE course (e.g. whether coursemates tend to be close to one another). The social aspect is a big thing for me since colleges in Oxford/Cambridge are pretty tight-knit and you end up making really great friends.

I'd also be keen to learn more about career prospects (particularly investment banking/consulting), as well as the prestige of the MS CSE program. I've heard that master's programs in the US are often seen as cash cows and that undergrads, rather than master's students, are mainly recruited for BB/EB IBD or MBB.

This is as opposed to continuing on as a 4th year undergrad at Oxbridge. Oxbridge undergrad is seen as the most prestigious thing you can do in Europe - for example, MBB in London almost exclusively recruit from Oxbridge undergrad - so from a practical standpoint, would it just make more sense to stay in the UK?

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person and any usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me.

I've had visitors get right up on me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

0.0,1598780830.0,79.0,Harvard,"Hello. Throwaway here.

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

I am not a Harvard student myself, but a few things here confused me, and I was wondering whether anyone here would have insight into *why* some survey results are... the way they are.

• The number of students with an income of 500K+ seemed to hang around 13-14% for the classes of 2017/18, 15% for 2019/20, and 17% for 2021/22 (the class of 2023 had a “prefer not to say” option. Is this just inflation, is this trend insignificant, or is the number of ultra-rich students slowly creeping up?


• In the classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019, the % Jewish was 9.5, 9.8, and 10.1 respectively. Since then, it has not exceeded 7.7, with a new low of 5.3 for the class of 2023 (2022 was 5.4%). Is this response bias, or are fewer Jews matriculating?

• In the classes of 2017 and 2018, 12.5 and 12.8% of students had received mental health counseling. This number has crept up through the high-teens, and is now at 25.3% for the class of 2023, up from 21.8% for the class of 2022. Is this because of greater access to therapy, admissions changes, or a general societal trend?

• Most “National Politics” questions were “culture war” related, with some being *extremely*  niche. Why are there questions on transgender individuals in the military and separation of families at the border, but not a *single* question on education, healthcare, or economics? These are generally considered (along with climate change) to be the most mainstream voter issues.

I also wanted to say, the class of 2023 looks *quite* impressive. The whole report is fascinating as well — I am extremely impressed.

I'm not really thinking of applying to these schools, more so I am just looking for information that is vague and the program is so new.

Obviously the first thing you do when you decide what master's program is your target is google what schools actually offer the masters. Scrolling down a bit past the ads and the 6th university website listed for Biotech masters was Harvard Extension. I'm here because I clicked on it to see what's up since I clicked the other 5 universities before it.

The whole process of earning admission with classes is pretty strange to me, but it seems interesting. Except I only heard of Harvard Extension prior for being a school of Ivy Rejects (it's quite a foul name), so is this program even worth the time, effort, and money for a Harvard University degree: Master of Liberal Arts (ALM) in Extension Studies, field: Biotechnology. (Copy pasted from the website.)

Seemed strange so I did look into the school a little more out of curiosity to see if they offer another ms in biotech (curiosity because of the strangeness), short answer yes but you have to take it with the MBA. Why? I mean sure I probably wouldn't get in with my GPA but if someone who really just wants the MS from Harvard in Biotech, why is it combined?  I looked a little further and even if you get denied by the dual program you can still get into the MBA program only, but not the MS program only? This approach for the degrees in biotech from Harvard's graduate programs seems strange so I was hoping for some clarification since I can't find much on MS/MBA program (it started in 2019 and has 1 page of info...).

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

Removed | Not Removed
---|---
[Exhibit A](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bjbaqy/about_to_be_a_graduate_from_hes_with_extension/) | [Exhibit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/admddj/hes_what_time_are_grades_posted/) 
[Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5ji6qb/can_i_tell_my_friends_i_go_to_harvard_if_its_hes/) | [Exhibit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/aixskc/hes_alb_acronym_history/)
[Exhibit C](https://reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/4i9dj4/harvard_extension_schoolbad_rep/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi60_eju97qAhVJ5awKHUwKA1MQFjACegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jG4m3obD13F7ucQU3j9FV) | [Exhibit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/92d6t7/my_harvard_email_not_deleted_after_my_class_at/)

I hope the distinction is clear from these examples. If not, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain further. 

---

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action.

I did not believe it at first because my friend thought it was one of those dubious emails.

Apparently licenses are given out.

My friend studied business/management (with a concentration in finance) but wanted to *become gorgeous and then*  go into acting / film-making (and thought of one day using photoshop, premier pro etc.). He does not know how to use *any* of the tools from the Adobe suite (except maybe adobe reader for reading adobe pdf files).

My friend is really grateful for the gift but also a little concerned because artists don't generally fare well (except maybe Terrence Malick &amp; Darren Aronofsky &amp; Matt Damon etc.)

Did any other grads/students get a free license  to software ? If so, what are you folks going to do with it?

The whole country seems to have stopped caring, even though we still know hardly anything about covid.

The cough is just a side affect of this, by the time your coughing it’s already done damage to your kidneys, brain, literally every organ. It mutates every two weeks, with a mutation in Italy resulting in it being up to 10x more contagious then the Wuhan strain. 

It’s going to be an absolute shit show at college campuses in the fall. Headlines like “Every student at Cornell forced to quarantine, 20 dead, over 60% of students positive”. Harvard starting small with a pilot program they are likely to be able to manage is the smart thing to do. And bringing back freshmen first is also the smart thing to do.

If you're like me you should have gotten an email from [harvard@electionservicescorp.com](mailto:harvard@electionservicescorp.com) today with your Your Election Validation Number to vote in the Harvard University's Board of Overseers and for Elected Directors of the Harvard Alumni Association (HAA). This is the highest democratically elected Alumni board at Harvard and they have been filled with HAA selected alumni for a long long long time. So a group called Harvard Forward is working to democratically elect 5 candidates to the Board of Overseers to move Harvard forward (get it?) on divesting from fossil fuels, committing more resources to climate-focused initiatives, including recent alumni into our governance, and giving a greater voice to students. 

One of the candidates (John Beatty) is a friend from my time at Harvard's Environmental Action Committee so I can attest that this group is filled with super-stars. 

**Harvard Forward Five for Overseers**: Margaret ""Midge"" Purce, Jayson Toweh, Lisa Bi Huang, John Beatty, Thea Sebastian 

**Endorsed HAA Directors (choose 6 of 7):** 

Kelsey Trey Leonard, Joyce Y. Zhang, Mallika J. Marshall, Vanessa Zoltan ​​​​​​, Santiago Creuheras, Benjamin D. Wei, Michael D. Lewis

Instructions to vote: [https://www.harvardforward.org/vote](https://www.harvardforward.org/vote) 

A little about Harvard Forward: 

 **We recognize that there are many things happening in the world right now that need your attention.** The coronavirus pandemic is ongoing, and the Black Lives Matter movement still needs our unfailing support and attention. Many Harvard affiliates have stepped up in the fight to create a more just society and to support those who are suffering. Now it is time for Harvard, as an institution, to follow in their footsteps and take up the mantle of moral leadership and decisive action.   


The Harvard Forward candidates aren't just running on a platform of climate action, responsible investing, and inclusive governance. **They're running to send a message that alumni demand better than the status quo**; that alumni are looking to Harvard to take a stance on the critical issues that are directly threatening the wellbeing and existence of current and future generations.  


**This means addressing not just climate change but also systemic racism**, and Harvard Forward is committed to making anti-racism a larger part of our platform. We're currently reaching out to those in the Harvard community who are leading anti-racism organizing to find out how we can best support their efforts, and we'll share our progress with you as it develops.   


**We know that a majority of** **Harvard** **alumni believe that** **Harvard** **can and must do better.** We simply need to get the word to them that this year's Board election is the opportunity to create a mandate for change.  

If we get these guys on the board - **this would make history** by having candidates elected and represented by the people, not by being nominated by HAA. Last year less than 12% of alumni voted - if you see this and vote and then share it, it makes a real difference. Our community is small and I'm sure you know friends that would be interested as well - please forward.",Vote today in Harvard's elections,t3_hjnb2v,11.0,0.88

Last August, in a lawsuit brought by fraternities and sororities to challenge the policy, Judge Gorton of the United States District Court in Boston denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the case. In essence, the court accepted the plaintiffs’ legal theory that the policy, although adopted to counteract discrimination based on sex, is itself an instance of discrimination based on sex. The court reasoned that the policy applies to men but not women who seek to join all-male social organizations and applies to women but not men who seek to join all-female social organizations, and that this constitutes sex discrimination under federal law. In reaching this view, Judge Gorton relied heavily on the reasoning in one of the appellate decisions (Zarda v. Altitude Express) that was affirmed by the Supreme Court. It now seems clear that Judge Gorton would ultimately grant judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor in the pending lawsuit and that Harvard would be legally barred from further enforcing the policy. 

In view of the Supreme Court’s decision, following Judge Gorton’s prior opinion in the lawsuit against Harvard, the Corporation consulted with the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Dean of Harvard College, and the University’s General Counsel last week. We together came to the view that, in the circumstances, the College will not be able to carry forward with the existing policy under the prevailing interpretation of federal law. As a result, following a vote of the Corporation on Friday to rescind its prior approval, the policy will no longer be enforced.",Sanctions against final clubs were just lifted,t3_hi98yi,10.0,0.71

- what are some downsides to this program being online? Time will tell, but I’m interested in hearing if people think this format will decrease the value of the program?

Our three primary goals are to improve transparency and communication, build community, and identify needs and innovate solutions. We share health education material, resources for students, and opportunities to serve our greater community through our[ resources spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTerz_XiSYghoEMn01biDnqqBM_pQIa3S8o-BhEKy-s/edit#gid=531738015) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studentsvspandemics/), write policy memos for state legislators, organize virtual COVID hackathons, address the digital disparity, and launch other initiatives. SvP gained over 100 volunteer members within a week of its launch and is now there are over 370 members from different chapters all over the country (more chapters oversea are being built!)

We are constantly looking for experts in all fields. As we know, we are in a huge public health crisis from COVID-19 and systemic racism; and interdisciplinary efforts are needed more than ever.

Now that 6 grad schools are officially going online for the Fall international students have been advised to not move to the US until in-person classes restart.

First, obviously Math 55 catches my attention and I would like to take it but I wonder if it might be too overwhelming for my first year. Does anyone have any insight into the workload for that class? If I am eventually going to be introduced to, in other math classes, all of the topics covered in this one class, I don't see it as beneficial to me to suffer through an accelerated class that throws it all at me at once. Can I learn all the topics covered in Math 55 through other math courses at Harvard spread across my undergraduate curriculum?


Second, is it common for undergraduate math students to remain at Harvard for their PhD studies as well? I am very interested in the work of one of the professors at Harvard on computational number theory. I was thinking I would like to study under him for my future PhD.

I'm an incoming freshman at Harvard, and have been doing research into whether any of my AP credit will be transferable. On the Advanced Standing portal of the Undergraduate website, there have been some changes listed to Harvard's system for the Class of 2024, namely that...

&gt;Admitted students who enter the College as freshmen in Fall 2020 (the Class of 2024), and all subsequent classes, will not be eligible to receive Harvard College degree credit for pre-matriculation credentials earned in secondary school. This means that Advanced Placement examinations, the International Baccalaureate diploma, and international credentials will no longer be recognized for Harvard College credit toward the degree beginning with the students who enter the College in Fall 2020. These examinations will continue to serve as valuable placement tools, and certain examinations may still fulfill the College’s language requirement.

Do you know if it's still required to send Harvard the scores for this year? I'm losing a little bit of motivation to still study these next few weeks now that the scores won't be accepted for credit. If a student were to fail his or her AP exams, would that be grounds to possibly rescind them? Is there a way to still cancel planned AP exams before taking them? Do you know if matriculating students are required to send AP exam scores or can you choose not to?

With everything going on, I completely understand any guesses at this point are pure speculation. But, I suspect some of you are substantially more informed on this than me. I know Harvard accepted 30 more people this year (1980) to maybe account for any covid-19 related deferrals or offer refusals. My question is how much will those 30 more admitted students affect the usage of the waitlist this year. 

Last year, 65 people were accepted off the waitlist. Any chance that number will be higher this year. And if so, how much so? Something interesting to note is that school who historically haven't utilized waitlist at all like Princeton and Dartmouth started to pull from the waitlist before May 1. And, UPenn dean of admissions openly announced, a few days after ivy day, that he predicted they would heavily use the waitlist this year. Granted, these schools don't have the yield Harvard has historically had, but its still weird how they resorted to the waitlist that early when they haven't admitted anyone off it in years past.

Since then, I have thought a lot about taking a gap year and being in the class of 2025 instead of 2024. The problem is that the decision date for deferring my acceptance is May 1 and I can't change later when the situation is more clear.

Harvard announced today that they will have Fall 2020, but have made no decisions about online or on-campus learning. If they go totally online, then they will give another opportunity to defer and I will do that. However, my question is: if the fall semester begins on campus, is it worthwhile to take a gap year? I really want a good freshman experience and the best possible four years that I can. I know that next year is not going to be normal, there will probably be no sporting events or big gatherings, maybe limitations on parties, some online learning, and the chance that everyone gets sent home again. 

On the other hand, if the corona situation is really bad, there also might not be many opportunities for me on a gap year.

- social atmosphere

- grade inflation/ higher avg gpa(i might want to go onto business school later on + Harvard likely has more connections)

- it’s harvard (world wide prestige — kind of a dream school for me)

Harvard cons: 

- their cs department isn’t on the same level as MIT

- maybe less opportunities for cs internships, since Harvard seems to be leaning more liberal arts

MIT PROS: 

-strong cs dept

- collaborative culture

MIT CONS: 

- too geeky/nerdy 

- difficult (lower avg gpa)

- maybe more competitive for CS internships since like 1/2 the people major in CS

More Qs: are all the College classes just pre-recorded or is there a live Zoom component? I'm also curious, is there a difference in perspective amongst grad students, mid-career grads and college students?

I'm a grad student and absolutely love learning online. Most grad students have also spent time working and learning to delineate between work, school and leisure - a learned bevavior that quickly becomes important. One of the reasons it works from me, aside from my learning style, is the flexibility it affords my work. I've lived in three countries this last year, mostly for work, and am able to continue my classes uninterrupted. I especially appreciate the live Zoom classes and the interaction with other students. I don't think that'd make a world of a difference if it was in person (unless we're looking to make friends - but even then, I remain in touch with quite a few students post-semester.)

Initially, I thought it was going to be a breeze since I worked during undergrad and managed well; but, online learning requires a new type of discipline that took months to cultivate. (I saved my in class needs for learning languages but also transitioned those to online format once I left the country.) Making that transition isn't easy but can be rewarding.

To raise money for BHCHP’s efforts, we are selling [professionally-made, high-quality t-shirts](https://www.bonfire.com/bike-harvard-covid-care-for-the-homeless/), designed by two Harvard students, Sophia Liu and Emma Daugherty.

Homeless individuals are at high risk for contracting COVID-19 and may lack access to adequate testing and treatment, as well as a safe way to self-isolate. That’s why we are donating 100% of proceeds from our t-shirt sales to [Boston Health Care for the Homeless](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__www.bhchp.org_%26d%3DDwMFAg%26c%3DWO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ%26r%3DfqZSaKMQwMQx9yNG6GjGYaaudjyzyc-3mQLjY3D0s2U%26m%3D0Vxxbtoin5yDTmsInZtX56Ffrc-6scyAxxOUvLZrlt4%26s%3DdL6VQMPEvbz9huDTP78Wj-KXTb1_eOqJmdDCJT3vr8g%26e%26fbclid%3DIwAR2q4qLIAsqN9LfwG7BLpe-SS_nD1Jgf-tPDmtju-f2ppUEZpebRfcziFZM&amp;h=AT00f7WRnfZR-Kv5bscphNMAvWyEQfyWX8srnCk6cERZijroLTKp0slWXLICoSm41VUBQsg1lJh4DyLdwwbgzyhCKOa7Gdl0GdV4dBLkKeb-z08Ys-IlbjDJcOmoJBIKLuwiMQUJx8DO3u8yoeo), a Boston-based nonprofit committed to helping the most vulnerable Bostonians obtain access to critical healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. BHCHP runs three testing tents, an isolation tent, a 24/7 hotline and mobile clinic to screen and treat homeless individuals at high risk of contracting COVID-19. BHCHP is also equipping and operating Boston’s two new medical tents designed to accommodate the anticipated large volume of people who screen positive.

A single t-shirt can go a long way! Help BHCHP screen, protect, and treat the homeless population in Boston through funds for PPE, medical equipment, food, and medication for patients.

About BHCHP: The integrated care model at BHCHP unites physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, case managers and behavioral health professionals in close collaboration. They follow patients in a variety of settings --- on the streets, at the Barbara McInnis House, in our shelter-based clinics, in the hospitals and in housing --- providing regular contact and uninterrupted care.","Buy a T-shirt, help the homeless!",t3_fwsxkj,7.0,0.89

I'm a newcomer, who is going to be attending one of the graduate programs here (SEAS). No previous residential history on East Coast, so this is a big leap for me, and due to no physical admit welcome programs because of COVID, so some of the knowledge that organically gets transferred seems to be missing for me.

1. HUHS options seem pretty bad. The facilities look a sad and underinvested, seems priced as much as off-campus housing, lack in-unit laundry, and charge a whole lot extra for parking. Coming in from pretty suburban lifestyle. Do graduate people (late 20's - early 30's ) at Harvard choose HUHS? What's the draw I am missing here?
2. Off-campus housing: Any neighborhoods I should avoid within? I can't actually physically visit right now due to COVID (in west coast). Any input on neighborhoods would be appreciated. Places in review: Allston, North Brookline, West Cambridge, Cambridgeport, Riverside, The Port, Inman Square, Ward Two.

In your experience or best judgement, what would you recommend I suggest? To rephrase the question, what specific things could a high school student do for a lab virtually in times like this?

I intend to do bioengineering/biomedical engineering on a pre-med track and go to medical school after graduation. I want a school with good pre-med experience and generally good advising.

I love to write and that's also something I'd like to do (i.e. I'd like to perhaps get involved at a school publication). I want a school that would allow me to pursue these hobbies as well as allow me to build a solid pre-professional experience.

Harvard's history is marked with numerous occasions when crisis lead to momentous change for the University's constituent schools. The most notable of these events for the purpose of my post is how Radcliffe Women began attending lectures with men only when male attendance dropped during the Second World War. Now is such a moment for the Extension School. 

Once we have contained or survived the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus (and we will survive), all members of the Harvard community should note how much of a resource the Extension School is for the entire university. Not only has it be tacitly (and intently) preparing for widespread distance education for generations, it also provides the University with insight and a diversity of perspectives the University would not have otherwise. 

Furthermore, HES reaches some of the poorest, and most disadvantaged people affiliated with the University. Presidents Faust and Bacow have discussed how Harvard needs to use its ""greatness"" to do more ""good"". Well... HES has been at the forefront of this goal since 1909.

While most people in r/Harvard may demand for the ""In Extension Studies"" tag to be removed from diplomas, I suggest 3 other reforms that will integrate HES more with the broader Harvard community.

1) Open University Apartment Housing up to HES degree students, at least undergrads. Students in Columbia's undergraduate parallel to HES, the School of General Studies (GS), are allowed to enter the housing lottery for their version of University Apartment Housing.

2) Allow HES degree candidates to enroll directly for all FAS classes (prerequisites permitting). Again, Columbia already does this which results in more veterans, mothers, minorities, and professional artists in their classes.

3) Seek donations for (or just build with the \~$40B endowment) a ""House"" for extension programs. This house can rent out rooms to students visiting for on-campus weekends, or to full time students taking all their courses on-campus. It also would give the Extension School a more visible presence on campus, and a new permanent home for a revived Grossman Library. (As an urban planner, I think the Church St. parking lot would be a great place for an ""Extension House"".)

I hope some of you agree with this assessment. Harvard's response to the coronavirus opens a door for HES to ascend to a place within the University it already should hold. I encourage everyone to email the school, the University, and any professor they know to highlight the importance of the Extension School for the entire University. The coronavirus may linger, but it will become old news as quickly as it became a pandemic. Its legacy must be used to improve the University, and one way this can be accomplished is to support the Extension School, and its degree students as much as any other degree candidate.",A Pivotal Moment for the Extension School,t3_fhi4x4,23.0,0.87

It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&amp;adults=1&amp;check_in=2020-04-22&amp;check_out=2020-04-30&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from.

Or can my AP US History exam go toward a credit in my Government major?

All I’ve been able to find on Harvard’s website is that I can either transfer 32 credits worth of AP tests or none at all, and transferring those 32 credits would mean I’d be in Academic Standing.

0.0,1581641533.0,36.0,Harvard,"As I stood in the mirror last night and admitted to myself that I wanted to declare econ I mentally prepared myself for the onslaught that living my truth as a lover of economics would entail. 

I first want to say that declaring econ is not a choice, I didn't wake up one day and decide ""I want to pick the most popular concentration that offers some of the most lucrative job opportunities after graduation"",  I woke up one morning clutching a copy of Wealth of Nations and blabbering to my roommate about reverse causality. 

To some of you it may seem like I am equating the struggle of being an ec concentrator with that of LGBTQ Americans, and you would be right, that's exactly what I am doing (because this is satire). Some would say that the backlash ec conentators face is actually more nefarious than regular-ol homophobia; I think much of the hatred of econ is based in the view that it is twinged with pre-professionalism and that students in the field  have merely forgone Harvard's fantastic academic opportunities to study something that will get them a job at Goldman. Regardless of whether or not that is true, the notion that Harvard students should not focus on finding a job and making money post grad has undertones of a quiet privilege, deaf to students from economically insecure backgrounds who do not feel they have the luxury of entering the job market without classically marketable job skills, and inconsiderate of other colleges and universities that serve merely as engines of economic mobility and not academic playgrounds. 

This is not to say that every hist and lit concentrator is some trust fund baby and every econ concentrator is a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who wants to work in investment banking to support his or her family, far from it, this is merely to say we would be remiss if we did not examine the ways in which class, privilege, and economic security permeate our decisions to come to Harvard and how we decide to spend our time while we are here.

My current interest is in international affairs, and as of now I envision my career path as something in that field, whether it be working for the government or a think tank/NGO or something like that. 

Going in, I have a relatively firm belief that my primary concentration will be Government, but I’m undecided on whether or not I want my secondary field to be in East Asian Studies or German.  I feel somewhat compelled to worry about this now because I saw that I would have to be fluent in either language (Mandarin or German) in order to take advantage of study abroad in those areas, as well as taking advantage of internships/work abroad, so I’ll have to learn the language prior to junior year I think. If this is wrong, or if this is something y’all think my academic advisor or someone like that can help me with in time, please let me know. 

My justification for studying German is that I have a deep love of German culture and history, and the idea of studying abroad in any German speaking country appeals to me. Also, if at some point in my career I have to work abroad, I’d rather be living in Germany/Austria/Switzerland/some German speaking country rather than China. Also, Germany being arguably the most important country in Europe, I think it will have use. 

My justification for studying Mandarin is that I find Sino-American relations extremely interesting from the policy perspective, and I think that it’ll become the most important country America has relations with, so studying Mandarin will bear the most fruit. My current conception is that living in China if I must would not be that nice (at least compared to German-speaking nations), but please tell me if that conception is wrong. 

I’m kinda torn, so guidance would be appreciated.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions.

&gt;On November 27, 2019, Harvard University denied tenure to an ethnic-studies professor specializing in Dominican identity. Students and faculty at Harvard and across the country sprung into protest mode. The failure to tenure Lorgia García Peña, they said, resulted from Harvard’s racism. NBC Nightly News, the *New York Times*, the *Boston Globe*, and other outlets covered the controversy from the same angle.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, García Peña had been catapulted into the academic firmament with a speed that most non-intersectional professors can only dream of. She has been showered with benefits. Thirty-one percent of Harvard’s tenure-track professors lost their tenure bids in the 2018‒19 academic year without alleging bias, since most of those failed contenders were white. Yet García Peña has gone through her academic career playing the victim, reflexively accusing those around her of white supremacy. In this, she is a perfect synecdoche for ethnic studies itself, which also stakes its identity on the conceit that it is in a nonstop battle for survival against the forces of racism and exclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;To the contrary, ethnic studies is ascendant. It is spreading rapidly throughout K‒12 schools; its ideology has already bled into the political realm. It’s worth reviewing García Peña’s career as an emblem of a fast-rising academic field whose worldview is taking over American culture.",Ethnic Studies 101: Playing the Victim.

0.0,1578965509.0,45.0,Harvard,"Last semester was overall a really good one for me. I met so many great people, and I am grateful I was able to so quickly find a niche at the big bustling nerve-wracking world of Harvard.

A big part of that was thanks to the Harvard Crimson, which was far more welcoming and accepting than I could have hoped for. It's truly such a great organization. Its comp process was long and challenging, but my comp directors made the experience completely manageable, light-hearted, and fun. We got to publish multiple articles and benefitted from the experience and expertise of thoughtful, wise editors.

So the Crimson-ICE controversy absolutely broke my heart. On multiple occasions, it brought me to tears. I am a sensitive person, and I try my best to be a moral person. I'm quite left-wing, and strongly support abolish ICE, the decriminalization of immigration, and taking in as many refugees as possible.

And yet I can't escape a simple, clear conviction I have come to: The Crimson was in the right, Act on a Dream in the wrong.

Act on a Dream was absolutely unreasonable in their demands and thoughtless in their actions. The main purpose of a public protest is to demonstrate public support for a cause. The free press has an obligation to scrutinize and duly report on protests, which benefits just social movements by spreading their message and reach. Reaching out to a government agency for comment is never an endorsement of said agencies' actions, nor does it inherently put students in danger. If ICE wanted to prey on undocumented students at Harvard, they would do so regardless of if a comment is asked. ICE's non-comment on the article is demonstrative of their uncaring attitudes to the lives of this country's many brilliant and brave undocumented students. Therefore, the Crimson, without resorting to biased reporting, was able to demonstrate the strength and moral conviction of the Abolish ICE movement in Harvard's community.

Then, Act on a Dream threw that all away by attacking the Crimson for conducting a routine component of journalism. The boycott by various Harvard student groups only did three things: ensure that their efforts and movements would not be reported on with their voice accounted for, cause people both in and outside of the Harvard community to think less of these vital causes, and spread misinformation about the actions and the nature of the Crimson as an organization. I've talked to many students, all otherwise smart and lovely people, who had completely warped views of the situation. Some thought the Crimson literally gave ICE the names of undocumented students, or that we collaborated with them to undermine the protest. I heard people talking about vandalizing the Crimson's headquarters. When people don't trust the Crimson, they will have trouble gaining a full, nuanced perspective on complex campus issues.

Student activists have wasted so much time and effort attacking their fellow students, and allies in making Harvard a fair and just community. It makes me so upset the wasted potential this unnecessary conflict created.

I want us all to move on

So, as an anonymous internet person, I hope that we all can find peace and cooperation in the next semester. I hereby give full, unconditional forgiveness to the people who have slandered my peers, and caused the national press to ridicule the Harvard activist community. I love you all, and I know most of you are good people.

If you want to make a difference on campus, one of the best ways is to comp the Crimson this coming semester. We have a generous financial aid program and do not cut anyone during the comp. All are welcome. Love and mercy everyone.",Harvard Crimson,t3_eoe0uq,45.0,0.9

Sadly, I quickly discovered that none of the available designs appealed to me. Given my background, I saw a great opportunity to disrupt the traditional collegiate jewelry industry by breathing some fresh air into the designs and distribution models and i'm excited to say that **Harvard has officially given me the license and rights to use all Harvard insignias and logos.** I have the green-light and am ready to start laying down some foundation for this business!

I don’t want to be rude or call anyone out, but I’m afraid of Harvard’s social sphere. A fair share of posts in this subreddit are about how lonely and sad Harvard students feel, the lack of a dating life, and so on. This just kinda worries me a bit. I kinda hoped getting into Harvard was like this golden ticket and life would be all butterflies and rainbows after I started college. Obviously, this was super naive, but now it seems like it might even be the opposite. I already struggle with sadness and loneliness right now and I’d hate for college to amplify them. 

I’m already somewhat introverted. In high school, I finally made some solid friends, but it took until senior year for me to find them.  I’m afraid that finding friends at Harvard might take too long. I wish I thought of this earlier because by now it’s too late to apply to other schools, specifically MIT. MIT seems like it might be a better fit for me (I want to study comp sci and am pretty nerdy in liking engineering), but the all-nighter horror stories and my annoying mit tour guide scared me away from applying, which I now sincerely regret. MIT seems to have a ton of sciencey, nerdy people that I get along well with. So far all the Harvard people I met are super into social justice, liberal arts, and debating, which is fine and cool, but not really the kind of people I associate with.

Also, a minor point about the people, everyone seems to be way more accomplished than me by just looking at their Instagram pages. Imposter syndrome is already coming in hot :(

Finally, sports are a minor issue I have about Harvard. I was hoping to play my sport at Harvard, but even if I could play, the D1 level of athletics seems very hard core and I don’t know if I could handle it, if even afforded the opportunity. I am aware of club options, but I don’t know much about it. 

I should also state that I am still almost certainly coming to Harvard. I didn’t really apply to any school that I would choose over Harvard. I really just want to know how I can make sure the social life goes well for me. I realize that it might be early to start worrying about this since I haven’t even been at Harvard for one day, but I’d rather be prepared for the worst. Thanks

TLDR: I am going to Harvard in the fall, but I’m afraid that a sciencey introvert like me will have trouble making friends, dating, and not getting depressed. It might be early to worry about this, but I’d like to know about all I can in advance. Any advice on how to avoid that would be super appreciated.",How to be happy at Harvard,t3_ej6w8z,32.0,0.89

I know this sub gets tons of posts just like this, and right now is probably prime time as we’re all reeling from the semester and getting back long-anticipated grades. I’ve spent tons of time brooding these thoughts, and hesitating to post because we’ve all heard this story before, but idk man, I really want these feelings off my chest. Either way I really am sorry in advance for the ranty long post ahead.

It’s 11:22 pm on the 31st and I’m unironically sitting in my bed in my dead quiet house while the rest of the world is celebrating New Years’ Eve. It’s not that I didn’t want to party. I just didn’t get invited anywhere. It’s given me even more time to ruminate than was already unhealthy, and now all the bad thoughts are just melting together and really letting me have it.
 
My first semester kind of sucked. I know it wasn’t the worst it possibly could have been, but it sure wasn’t good. Now I know this is pretty normal, but so many things that were bad about it are part of broader problems, and I know they won’t just magically resolve themselves. I feel really angry lately, which is just an intensification of previous, constant feelings of sadness, emptiness, paranoia and self-blame that have stretched back since early in high school. When I have memories about the semester, if I close my eyes and re-envision my state of mind when I had time to think— on those routine walks to/from the dhall, to class, wherever— with minimal exception, I could only ever recall feeling angry, sad, or just nothing. It was constant by around the second week of classes. Feeling nothing but either distinctly bad, or just nothing. Just flat. And that flat feeling wasn’t much better than bad, because it would devolve into bad at the drop of a hat. The same didn’t go for good; something cool could happen, and I could feel relaxed for once, but the bad ruminations and mean inner criticisms would crowd out those feelings so quickly that I look back and hardly remember the good times even happened. By the end of the semester I felt like I was slowly losing my spirit. Just fading into something vaguer and vaguer every day. I felt like who I was there was just some even worse, even less likable version of whatever confused sad thing I was before.

My approach to these feelings this semester was mostly to isolate myself when I got into a really negative spiral, which ended up being pretty often after the first few weeks. I would avoid developing my friendships, not because I didn’t want to have friends, but because despite my efforts to cheer up, it was honestly really, really difficult to not appear cold and dismissive and terse in conversation even though none of that had a single thing to do with the other person. It’s not that I turned into an absolute asshat during those moods, or was explicitly mean, and it’s certainly not that I never talked to people. I really did have a some normal, good days, some great meals where I felt just fine and slipped back into my sort of funny, chill self. It’s just that I didn’t do it enough, and now I’m worried the withdrawn brooding side is all some people might remember. I could have done so much better. I just gave up and withdrew into myself too many times in the dhall or in classes or meetings with my EC. I could have done so much better. Not that I even know how to manage it, but I could have tried harder. I’m really concerned about the long-term effects of that behavior on my future ability to make friends here, because I’m paranoid that people have an image of me as this angry loner. Maybe kind of irrational, maybe not. I’m just angry at myself I let that side come out so often. We’re all people, we all get angry. Come on verisad, you’re supposed to develop methods to control yourself when you’re an adult. I’ve done a shit job with that. I shouldn’t have let it get this out of hand.

I’m just really disgusted with myself. I feel like that’s the best way I could describe it sometimes. Like when I kind of step outside myself, and look inward, I kind of cringe, because ew, look at me. I’m not performing particularly well at school (and know a few of my peers did consistently better, plus were good wholesome people, so the ‘it’s only first semester’ stuff is not really a tenable excuse), I have no friends, my jokes aren’t really that funny, I’m kind of weird and tryhard and awkward. Any people I met in the dhall, at my main EC, that I SHOULD have pursued friendships with, I either only half did, or just didn’t, because I guess I couldn’t deal with the effort of following it up, or just couldn’t reign in my emotions. I’ve even gained fifteen pounds, so when I’m not degrading myself in my head for whatever reason, no worries, I could always just look at my body and be fucking disgusted all over again. I came home thinking maybe being away from Annenberg would help me at least begin shedding the weight, slowly, since we generally don’t keep excess food in the house . . . nope, no change. And too bad the iota of motivation I actually did have to go work out in the beginning of the semester, when I got myself to the gym a few times, has totally burnt out.

I know we all have a mean inner critical voice and this is it talking. But the thing is, I feel like when we tend to say things like ‘don’t listen to the critical inner voice, because it’s irrational,’ my problem with that is that I feel like mine is, actually, pretty ‘rational’. I really do seem to deserve some, if not most, of the self-criticism. My personality is lacking somewhere. Not to make this about logic or anything, but it’s the inference to the best explanation. Take the real-life evidence, I don’t have friends. I’m not getting hit up. Never dated anyone. I’m a lonely person. I am capable of being outgoing and somewhat funny, but somewhere along the way the motor just burns out and somehow I can’t make and keep friends. I’m not extremely desirable friend or partner material, and I am doing this to myself, and am not getting better at not doing it to myself. 

I know it can change. Anything can change. It could get better, sure. Then it could get worse again. I told myself that things would change for the better in high school, and senior year — forget it, after Dec. 13th I thought I was holding that golden ticket, finally on my way to feeling ‘normal’ and fulfilled and with my own crowd. I remember the fever of the holidays. I binged the housing day videos when they came out, memorized all the flags and mascots. I watched that Adams rap video one in awe, feeling all fuzzy, like I was in on this special inside joke now. Well surprise, reversal of fortune, now who even knows if I’ll have a blocking group. I’ll have less than a month to figure it out. I just wish I gave it a little more effort. I couldn’t just suck it up and get back on the horse. That’s what life is about, getting back on the horse. And I couldn’t do it, and I don't know how to get better at doing it. I wish I could sorry to any person I was ever unfairly dismissive toward. I just want them to know how sorry I am, and that it wasn't their fault. It's also absolutely awful to consider the possibility that I could have contributed to even more bad feelings in others when I acted like that, and just continued the cycle and made it worse for everyone and helped screw over the aggregate pleasure, even if just a little. If anyone our there ever had someone just act mad around you for no reason, I'm sorry on their behalf. Maybe it was me. You didn't deserve that.

If anyone else had similar feelings first semester and wants to share any insight, I would really appreciate it. I'm currently talking to someone at CAMHS, and having some sort of evaluation soon where I guess they determine whether I should get on meds. That's kind of worrisome in its own right because my parents' divorce is leaving my mom in a really awful financial situation, and getting outside treatment is costly and I don't even want to think about stressing her out more, but we'll see. If anyone found other ways of coping that helped in the first year, it would mean a lot. 

I’m sorry this was a dump. If it’s too rambling, I’m sorry, delete it, or I will. I know it’s like anything else we all see and hear about here, but I seriously have nowhere else to put down these feelings. I hope everyone on this sub has a great New Years. You all work so hard and deserve the best. Whoever you are, I seriously hope you could find some solace from whatever you’re going through right now. I’m sure we could all use that right now.

I am a student from Southern California who will be moving (with a car) to Cambridge in August 2020 to start a masters program at Harvard. Disclaimer: I have read all posts I could find on this topic, but all of them seem to discourage car ownership by Harvard students as opposed to providing actual practical advice.

So with that said, could any fellow crazy car owners please share their thoughts or point me in the right direction? I am particularly interested in the following:

* What is the average cost for an off-street parking spot in Cambridge? Any recommended companies/landlords?
* If I am staying for 1 year, will I likely get busted for having out of state plates? According to the MA laws I read, there is no grace period to register your vehicle once you are an MA resident. That is in theory, how is it in practice?
* Is it easy to obtain a student parking permit? Are the garages fairly secure? How hard is it to find a space, typically?

So, idk if this is the right spot for this, but here goes:

This is my first semester (I’m a first-year) and it’s been the most miserable few months of my life. Every day I’ve been here I’ve just been sad. I know I’m clinically depressed and all that stuff, but I’ve never been this bad to the point where–now that I’ve got to take finals–I just want to curl up and die somewhere. 


Socially, I had a group for a little bit but there was a bit of a falling out–it wasn’t really anyone’s fault, but it was enough for me to distance myself and so I lost any sense of social belonging earlier in the semester. In terms of clubs, it’s just been a steady stream of rejections. And in terms of academics, I push myself so damn hard and I still get really shitty grades and I’m probably going to just end up with all Cs and maybe a B if I’m lucky. I just feel really inadequate all the time and everyone is always talking about grade inflation and complains about their A- or whatever, meanwhile I’m literally at the bottom of all my classes and I kind of just want to die because of it. I did go to a kind of shitty public school where I didn’t have to try very hard in general, but I’ve always pushed myself and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to fix anything in any aspect of my life and it’s been so incredibly frustrating. My finals have all been ass, even though I’ve given up what little time I made for myself to throw myself 100% into preparing for them. 

I tried to convince myself that, at the very least I could do something fun or cool over the summer because Harvard’s name–no matter how much I hate this place and no matter how miserable I’ve been–is powerful enough to open doors. I realize now how misguided that was, because I’m on-track to go home and be depressed for 3 months over summer break and nothing else. Maybe pick up an odd job or two but nothing relevant to my goals. 

I don’t know who to go to for support. CAMHS gave me the option of antidepressants or weird fucking support groups, that I know wouldn’t help me. My parents think that Harvard is the best place on earth and that I’m silly to be so sad while I’m here. I don’t have friends really. I’m just so at my wit’s end. I know it’s only one semester and I’m probably just a whiny idiot for complaining this much, but I really can’t see any way out of this mess. I don’t know if I should consider transferring, and even if I did, I don’t know what school would take my shitty GPA and useless/non-existent extracurriculars. A part of me thought that maybe this was something to discuss with PAFs or my advisor, but it seems like PAFs are just there to cart in food for study breaks and advisors to lift the hold on your account. 

And, even if I do stay at this school, I don’t see how things would be different next semester or the one after that or the one after that. It’s clear that I’m not academically capable enough for this school and there doesn’t seem to be a way for me to fix that. I’m just over everything kind of at this point. Life, Harvard,  everything else. 

I’m on mobile and I have fat fucking fingers so I apologize for any grammatical errors.

&gt;On Tuesday, December 10, 2019 El Jefe's Taqueria and the Harvard Varsity Club will be sponsoring the 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Fundraiser. For each of the last two years, we've had over 2,000 customers come to El Jefe's on this day and have raised over $27,000 each year. In addition, thousands more donated to the Benson M. Abercrombie ’21 Fund, established by the Harvard Varsity Club. Ben was a freshman at Harvard in Sept 2017 and was a defensive back for the Harvard Crimson Football Team. During Harvard's first game of the 2017 season, Ben suffered a catastrophic cervical neck injury and was paralyzed. What started as a beautiful fall day ended in tragedy for Ben and his family.

&gt;* Facing a lifelong struggle, Ben has worked incredibly hard over the last two years to build his life anew. Remarkably, in August less than two years after his injury, Ben came back to Harvard University and started his freshman year again. Let's let Ben and his family know that the Harvard Square and the Harvard University community continue to support his valiant efforts. Let’s make this 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Day even bigger and better than the first two! There are several ways to help:

&gt;* Come eat at El Jefe’s (83 Mount Auburn Street) on * Tuesday, December 10th from 8 am until 4 am. Every penny that comes in the door that day will go to Ben’s fund. Spread the word and bring your friends! Customers will also be given the opportunity to add additional monies upon check out.

&gt;*  you are unable to eat at the restaurant on the 10th, representatives from the Varsity Club and the Harvard Football Team will be onsite all day collecting credit card and cash donations.

&gt;* Donate online: harvardvarsityclub.org/abercrombiefund

&gt;We encourage you to share this information in order to make this our biggest fundraising total yet! Come by on Tuesday and say hi to Ben. He'll be on site for most of the day.","El Jefe's &amp; Harvard Varsity Club announce 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Fundraiser on Tuesday, 10 December",t3_e71vk0,12.0,1.0

0.0,1569110474.0,46.0,Harvard,"Here’s the abstract:

&gt;	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no one’s surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

&gt;	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn’t really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

* For the ""Earn-Your-Way-In"" admissions, I was thinking of taking the three suggested courses that are on the Extension School's website (EXPO 15, EXPO 25, and MATH E-3). The advisor I spoke to mentioned that they would count towards the degree itself. Any thoughts on this? How were the courses themselves?
* I noticed that there's an on-campus requirement. How was this for folks? Was it a pain trying to find parking/getting a parking pass from the university? (I live about an hour north of Cambridge in Maine)
* How were the online classes/courses? I'm no stranger to online learning, but I do know that every school has their own ""spin"" when it comes to online education.
* How's financial aid for the Extension School? I noticed that it was mentioned online, and briefly said by the advisor I spoke with, but is it generous (if needed, I would only be taking sixty-four credits for the degree, as I will have sixty-four credits transferring into the program itself; also, I currently have a 3.67 GPA, if that goes into academic scholarship decision-making).
* And lastly, for those of whom who have graduated from this program, is it worth it? I've read other comment sections/blogs/posts where some have had difficulties with their degrees, due to the phrasing of the degree itself (""Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies,"" even though they majored/concentrated in Environmental Studies), and was just wondering if there was any sort of ""stigma"" attached to the degree, or if the majority of what I read was just a bunch of hot air.

Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

All of us have been horrified by the revelations regarding Jeffrey Epstein, and I write today to update our community on steps we are taking in view of current information about his philanthropy to Harvard.

Let me start by emphasizing the obvious: Epstein’s reported criminal actions were utterly abhorrent. They flagrantly offend the values of our society and this institution, and we condemn them. We also recognize the profound pain that Epstein caused to his victims and their families, and we commend their courage in coming forward to bring his crimes to light.

Epstein’s connections as a donor to this University, and other institutions, raise important concerns. With that in mind, two weeks ago I asked for a review of his donations to Harvard. Our decentralization makes such a review more complicated than it would be at some other institutions. I want to emphasize that this review is ongoing. Our review to date indicates that between 1998 and 2007, Epstein made a number of gifts to support various faculty and institutional research activities across the University. The largest of these was a $6.5 million gift in 2003 to support the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. The University received other gifts, which totaled approximately $2.4 million, based on current information. Each of these gifts from Epstein and his affiliated foundations to Harvard University predates his guilty plea in June 2008. To date, we have uncovered no gifts received from Epstein or his foundation following his guilty plea. Moreover, we specifically rejected a gift from Epstein following his conviction in 2008. We have also recently learned that Stephen Kosslyn, a former faculty member and a beneficiary of Epstein’s philanthropy, designated Epstein as a Visiting Fellow in the Department of Psychology in 2005. We are seeking to learn more about the nature of that appointment from Dr. Kosslyn, who no longer works at the University.

The majority of Epstein’s gifts were designated for current use, not as endowed funds, and nearly all were spent years ago for their intended purposes in support of research and education. Our ongoing review of these gifts has identified one current use fund and one small endowment designated to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with a total unspent balance of $186,000. After consultation with the Dean of the FAS, we have decided that the University will redirect the unspent resources to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault. This is an unusual step for the University, but we have decided it is the proper course of action under the circumstances of Epstein’s egregiously repugnant crimes. The issue of the gifts given to institutions by donors at Jeffrey Epstein’s suggestion, is also one that has emerged in recent days, and we are looking into this as part of our ongoing review.

Epstein’s behavior, not just at Harvard, but elsewhere, raises significant questions about how institutions like ours review and vet donors. I will be convening a group here at Harvard to review how we prevent these situations in the future. I also hope to engage our peer institutions to consider how we can collectively improve our processes. We can all learn from each other.

Let me end where I began. Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible. I profoundly regret Harvard’s past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society. We act today in recognition of that fact. And we do so knowing that the scourge of sexual assault continues to demand our close attention and concerted action.

Harvard is not perfect, but you have my commitment as president that we will always strive to be better.

Sincerely,
Lawrence S. Bacow

0.0,1612387965.0,0.0,princeton,"Hi all,

Princeton has long been my dream school (more precisely, since sophomore year). You will see this reflected in the breakdown of my performance. 

I have a few LD’s, such as a bad case of ADHD and NVLD. I attended a special needs middle school and now attend a small prep school in NYC. Freshman year was challenging, as I was behind on the material and had anxiety from the greater expectations. I caught up over that summer, and perhaps fortuitously visited Princeton then too. I thought it impossible to ever attend, given my poor academic career. Nonetheless, I was inspired by the campus and kept it in mind. I worked diligently in sophomore year, saw significant improvement, and continue to now as a junior. 

One of my concerns lies in the fact that I never enrolled in an AP course. My school offers five across sophomore, junior, and senior years. In sophomore year, I had no chance of enrolling in one given my class trajectory. I applied for them this year, but didn’t get admitted. I was, however, enrolled in two honors courses for the first time. I plan on taking two APs and at least two honors next year as well. Could this “AP” dilemma be explained away, or will it irreparably damage my application? 

I have also heard that Princeton doesn’t consider freshman grades, but they are listed below in case that isn’t true - and for context. 

Anyway, here are my grades, **potential** test scores, extracurriculars, and awards across my three years of high school.


Intended major: Literature

*My school uses the 100 scale for GPA. I will make conversions to the 4.0 scale. 

- 9th grade: 81 GPA (2.7)
- 10th grade: 95 GPA (4.0)
- 11th grade (thus far): 95 GPA (4.0)

Class rank: 19/65 (brought down by 9th grade, would likely be top 10 without it) 

I will be taking the August SAT. My goal is a 1500+, and I intend to spend my breaks and summer studying. I have a private tutor and ample resources to realize this goal. In the event that I don’t, I may go test-optional. 

Current extracurriculars: 

- President and founder of Debate Society
- Editor of and contributor to school literary magazine
- Publisher for school newsletter
- Peer tutor
- Member of history tournament team

Planned additions:

- Debate Society competing in tournament
- Receiving recognition outside of school for literary works (publishing newspaper in local publication, submitting poetry online). 
- Delivering speeches at venues (likely virtual) over summer or in fall

It’s a simple list, I know - but these are the things I chose to do out of genuine passion. I’ve heard that less is more when it comes to EC’s, but please be the judge of that. 

Current awards:

- Deans List for two consecutive years
- Spanish department award (10th grade)
- Science department award (10th grade)

Projected additions: 

- At least two more department awards
- Awards for school extracurriculars (Debate Society tournament, school literary magazine, newsletter)

I don’t believe anyone from my school has been admitted to Princeton - or at least not for many years, but all other Ivies (with the exception of Dartmouth) and other top schools regularly take students from here. It may be because they don’t apply to Princeton (I haven’t heard of anyone doing so). 

I realize a lot of this is hypothetical. But if I do realize these academic goals, would I have a chance at Princeton? I intend to apply restrictive E.A. so they know how strong and personal this desire is.

I am not particularly hell-bent on getting all As, but I am currently failing two classes and am on the verge of failing another. I am pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADHD/executive function disorder, and I am going currently untreated for GAD. I seem to start assignments and cannot continue studying for more than 10 minutes at a time, after that I begin actively seeking distractions (napping, online browsing, cooking, chores etc). Additionally, I struggle to remember quantitative material, which makes my STEM courses particularly difficult to understand as most derivations are initially too difficult for me to understand. I think I would be able to focus or pass my classes if I maybe had one or two classes with no precepts or labs. 

What i've currently been doing to minimize my burnout has not been working. I stay in regular contact with my DSL, but I do not interact in any with my RCA or PAA as I genuinely do not enjoy my previous interactions with them or my advisory groups. I have been looking for a therapist to for my GAD for the past 8 weeks and I do not have my first appointment with them until after midterms. I am increasing the amount of times I go to office hours, but I notice for some of my classes that I do not have questions for my professors during office hours because they went over the material I am lost on over a week ago. I currently have a McGraw tutor in one of the classes I am not failing, but the limited amount of time does not allow me to learn the material in the way I need to actually retain it. I find it difficult to study regularly throughout the week, either I will spend 7+ hours of pomodoro method studying or I will do nothing all day. 

Has anyone else struggled this much with online learning, and is their anything I can do to  get my grades under control now? This current way of studying is unsustainable, and I am not of privilege to be able to take a gap year or defer in the future.

I know many in CS poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons I'm happy to get into if asked, I'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

My interests in CS lie primarily in machine learning (more because I have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security.

0.0,1595316592.0,2.0,princeton,"Hi! I’m an UCI research assistant and I was assigned the task of understanding how major selection works in a few top colleges, one of which includes Princeton. I was wondering if you guys could help me out with a few of your opinions; it definitely doesn’t have to be objective, I’m grateful for all the information, however subjective, I can collect. I've already perused the website and statements by admission officers, but I wanted to hear from actual students, so educated guesses (or even speculation) are all appreciated!

So, here are the questions:

1. Does Princeton require you to input an intended major on your application? Can you put undeclared?
2. If Princeton does require an intended major, after you’re accepted to Princeton with that intended major, does Princeton expect you to follow through? For instance, if a student picked “Computer Science,” will Princeton funnel that student into an engineering department and expect him/her to take engineering courses and activities, or does Princeton really treat everyone the same way no matter what they picked for intended major (at least until they declare)? Is there a limiting of options in regards to classes, activities, etc. for certain majors, even unintentionally?
3. I saw that there was a deadline difference between A.B. and B.S.E degrees, with B.S.E degrees having an earlier declared major deadline. Do you think this affects major selection/major changes (or generally anything about majors) in any way?
4. When does Princeton expect students to declare their majors by? Can a student be truly “Undeclared” up until the point of declaring their majors?
5. And lastly, based on your opinion, does intended major affect admissions? A lot of colleges I’ve looked into have stated publicly that the intended major does not affect admissions, but we also know diversity in ideologies (and thus major) is also important. This, of course, is a very touchy subject and I’m definitely not expecting the absolute, objective truth for this question; just wanted to hear your thoughts.

Other than these questions, if you have any other comments you could share about how students are pressured to take certain majors over others at Princeton, and any reason they would change their major: they would be appreciated!

0.0,1589253741.0,69.0,princeton,"Several students have been charged with honor code violations in MAT 202 in the 2020 Spring semester at Princeton University. These charges come at a crucial time during which students are completing Dean’s date assignments and studying for final exams. Under normal circumstances, this would be a very stressful situation, but considering the current state of affairs in the nation, it can be overwhelming for every student in the course.

An anonymous post was made on Tiger Confessions in which a person claiming to be a math PHD student and a TA for MAT 202 stated that the students had been baited by a professor. A quick look into Slader.com led to a contributor account with the user name “Arthur Dent.” This particular account had posted only four solutions. All of the four solutions were for problems from the fifth edition of Linear Algebra with Applications by Otto Bretscher, the exact book used by MAT 202. Of those four solutions, one was in the assigned problems for problem set 9, and two were in the assigned problems from problem set 10. Specifically, 8.1 #23, 8.2 #37, and 8.2 #70. The time at which the solutions were posted was provided in a correspondence email with a content director at Slader after a request was made. The solutions were posted April of 2020. Problem set 9 was due April 27th. Problem set 10 was due the following week. Further inquiry to this account led to the Slader representative indicating that the email associated to the contributor account seemed to be fake. A separate correspondence with Slader stated “Our moderators have confirmed that the answers given by that user were nonsense but written to look like they were reasonable.” The solutions have since been removed, however screenshots were taken and have been linked to this post.

I am a student at Princeton, and I made the poll in the MAT 202 GroupMe chat. Though I knew most students would be hesitant to participate, even a small amount of information would help shed light on what is going on. Currently, the poll stands at 9 students who claim their charges relate to problem #23 from section 8.1, one student claims their charge relates to problem #37 from section 8.2, and zero students have selected “none of the above.” I am not writing this message to accuse any professor of entrapping their students, what I intend to do is bring to light some peculiar information about a situation which has already raised many red flags. Cheating is not right, it reflects poorly on one’s character and negatively impacts peers who put forth an honest effort. But as detrimental as cheating may be, entrapment is just as harmful and just as dishonorable.

# It’s been over six years since Princeton professor Imani Perry  called the police because I criticized her in a blog post. I have still  not been arrested. But she has! Ain’t karma wonderful?

In July 2013, I wrote [this](https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/dr-imani-perry/) blog post where I criticized a section of [this](https://www.thehairpin.com/2013/07/teaching-trayvon/) article, which had been written by [Imani Perry](https://aas.princeton.edu/people/imani-perry), a professor of African-American Studies at Princeton University.

After I wrote that blog post, I wrote the following email to Dr. Perry:

*“I welcome you to show this to your students and anyone else whom you think might like to read it and comment on it.”*

Dr. Perry responded to my email by writing the following email to me:

*“I will be reporting you to the police for harassment.”*

Prior to this, I had thought that Ivy League universities only hired  professors who were interested in having discussions and debates over  topics with which they disagreed. It had never occurred to me that one  of them would call the police simply because someone disagreed with  something that they had said.

Which is why I was totally shocked to find out that Dr. Perry had called the police on me.

Well, it’s been more than six years since Dr. Perry called the police on me, and I still haven’t been arrested.

In the meantime, I recently did some googling to see what Dr. Perry has been up to.

And it turns out that Dr. Perry herself has been arrested!

It actually happened four years ago, but I just found out about it now.

In February 2016, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/us/police-release-video-of-traffic-stop-of-princeton-professor.html):

*The police in Princeton, N.J., released a dashboard video of the traffic stop of a black Princeton professor…*

*The video shows what appears to be a routine traffic stop with the professor, Imani Perry… She was then arrested…*

*After pulling Dr. Perry over, the male officer told her he had clocked her driving at 67 miles per hour in a 45-m.p.h. zone…*

*Fifteen minutes elapsed before the officer returned to her car to tell Dr. Perry that her license had been suspended…*

*About two minutes later, the officer returned to tell her she had a warrant out for her arrest over a parking offense from 2013.*

The previous years we've had actress Ellie Kemper, senator Cory Booker, director Baz Luhrmann, and novelist Jodi Picoult; however, none of these speakers' accomplishments are comparable to the magnificent Snoop Dogg (aka Snoop Lion).

Snoop Dogg is an iconic rapper who has changed the culture of the hip hop throughout his dynamic career. Being nominated for over 17 Grammy's (should've won 17...), selling over 35 million albums worldwide, and making hits like ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" makes Snoop Dogg more than qualified to deliver a brilliant and evocative speech to the Princeton community. Snoop Dogg's experiences are so unique that he even set the Guinness World Record for the largest paradise cocktail. Now that's a man that Princeton needs to learn from.

**given this, i'd not assume and falsely imagine cultural  ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, or other made up ideas**

- since i dont believe in these made up ideas anymore, i cannot talk in a way that assumes these made up ideas to actually be scientific facts in life, since there is no evidence 

**ppl in many culture &amp; nations live their life without the assumptions of these ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, etc**

- so this indicates that living without these falsely imagined ideas is possible



**we also do not know if everything is causally deterministic, but if everything were, then we would be sure that there's no agency, choice, and freedom etc**

in physics, some things are causally deterministic, and some things arent

- see https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/d2dd4z/open_discussion_according_to_the_best_physicists/

likely more than 50% of all things are not causally deterministic, and that by itself doesnt mean that agency, choice, and freedom exist



**if there were such imagined things as   agency, choice, and freedom, then to what extent is this agency choice &amp; freedom limited or constrained?**

nobody knows but we know it's highly limited &amp; constrained 

- we have no idea if an action is 'intentional' or not, be that our own or actions of others 

- without knowing if something is  intentional, we have no idea if this action is based on our control or not


**not only do we not know the extent, but dont know the minimal requirements of having agency, etc**

&gt; Nonetheless, it falls short of giving us everything we have reason to expect from account of personal autonomy.

&gt; In particular, challenges to different approaches sketched above suggest that they do not spell out the minimal conditions under which person’s exercise of authority over how she behaves reflects her own power to determine how she exercises this authority.

&gt; Minimal self-state seems to require nothing more nor less than being power behind whatever reasoning directly gives rise to one’s behavior.
Yet none of the accounts we have canvassed here seems to capture this important, most basic, form of self-state.

- see https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/#ChalIdenMiniCondPersAuto



**there are external (like gravity) &amp; internal factors (like from neuroscience) that all limit &amp; constrain our options, choices &amp; control over our destiny &amp; our lives**

Anyways, Google Maps has really great shots of the exterior of the building, and a wonderful 360 pic of Room 302 itself, but hardly anything of the interior leading up to Room 302. So, basically what I'm looking for is a continuous (unbroken), high-quality vid (iPhone quality, I guess) from the entrance of Frist to 302, and then maybe a second vid from 302 back down to the entrance.

The Princeton Datathon is hosted by Princeton ACM with Citadel LLC &amp; Citadel Securities in partnership with Correlation One. The event will take place on Saturday, September 22nd from 8:00am - 6:00pm at the Princeton University Friend Center.

Highlights include:

* **$25,000 in cash prizes!**

 Certain colleges \(e.g Dartmouth\) are known for being really tight\-kit while others \(e.g Columbia\) supposedly have a weaker sense of campus community. What is the community like at Princeton? Do you know a large percentage of your peers? Do people interact only with small social groups or is there campus\-wide community as well?

I visited Cornell and found it to be sort of massive and impersonal, while I loved Williams and Dartmouth. Where does Princeton fall on this spectrum? I know this is partially an issue of size but I'm particularly curious about the culture.

After careful research, I have concluded that this subreddit's banner color is not consistent with Princeton's color identity. In fact, it occupies some muddled ground in the color space between yellow, orange, gold, honey, tangerine, and carrot (see: [color shade names](https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/color-thesaurus-correct-names-of-shades/)).

According to the [Guide to Princeton University's Graphic Identity](http://trademrk.princeton.edu/secure/uisg/UniversitySG.pdf), ""Princeton Orange"" is defined as PMS 158, a spot color in the [Pantone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantone) Matching System color space. The Guide indicates that the hex equivalent to this color is [#ee7f2d](https://www.colorhexa.com/ee7f2d).

However, the [Office of Communications](https://communications.princeton.edu/guides-tools/logo-brand-assets) notes that PMS 158 is meant for use in print--paper, apparel, and sundries. On the web, Princeton uses [#e77500](https://www.colorhexa.com/e77500) on white backgrounds and [#f58025](https://www.colorhexa.com/f58025) on black backgrounds. Given the current formatting of this subreddit, the former seems to be the most appropriate choice.

Other considerations: The [2007 Princeton Athletics Identity Style Guide](http://trademrk.princeton.edu/secure/protected/AthleticsStyleGuide.pdf) defines ""Athletics Orange"" as PMS 165. However, like PMS 158, this is also meant for use in print. Additionally, ColorHexa refers to [#ff8f00](https://www.colorhexa.com/ff8f00) as Princeton Orange but this is inconsistent with the guidance provided in Princeton's own Guide to Graphic Identity.

Now that said, I was wondering where I could get in contact to talk about my project? also if you are interested in what kind of service we provide, I'd rather not pollute my dream's college redit. So PM me if you want to check what I do and give a feedback maybe?
I don't plan to infringe any rules of that reddit (please accept my apologize).

Best regards,

0.0,1520623242.0,6.0,princeton,"I've been accepted to the Master's program, and I have several questions about the department to ask before I accept the admission. I've tried reaching out to administrative staff and faculty, but so far all my emails/phonecalls to the department have been ignored. So I'll ask here.

0. **Does the department view Master's students as ""second-hand"" compared to the Ph.D. students?** There seem to be tons of resources for Ph.D. students (and Post-Docs), and I hear only good things about the program, but I've heard nothing about the perspective from a Master's program.

0. **Is research an option for Master's students?** I've been offered funding through a teaching assistantship, but I'm far more interested in research. The website seems to imply that research assistantship is reserved for Ph.D. and Post-Doc students.

0. **How social is the department?** I know this is a very broad and speculative question, but I'm generally interested in what kinds of events or social circles emerge within the department. For example, my current department has a very active social community in the grad program which plans picnics, movie showings, trivia nights, etc.

0. **What kind of resources are available to graduate students?** Another hard to answer question, but it's inspired by my current institution's strong student union. We have a student-run organization that is dedicated to advertising and fighting for TA and RA employment rights. I vaguely recall someone mentioning that the last time people at Princeton tried starting a union, the administration shut it down. I'm just looking for any comments related to this kind of resource.

0. **How is the political climate on/around campus?** I'm coming from a strongly liberal university located near a strongly conservative government institution. I appreciate the diversity of opinions in this area, and I love the many opportunities to be involved in political discussions.

0. **Anything else?** I'm happy to hear any comments about what life as a CS Master's student at Princeton might be like. It's a beautiful and old campus with a huge list of prominent alumni, but I want to know what to expect as an average student.

I'm interested in learning more about graduate life at Princeton University for those who chose to pursue a Ph.D. in Operations Research. 

Regarding pre-requisites, what is the required background you must have? I know this varies from university to university, but some schools, like Columbia, require Real Analysis, a class Engineers usually don't take. If a student lacks knowledge on a particular area, does Princeton give the student some time to catch up? For someone whose undergraduate education was in Engineering, how much ""catching up"" in advanced mathematics is there to be done? 

How many classes are you obligated to take in your first year? What would you say about the workload? 

Research-wise, is there an area that attracts the interest of more professors and students, or a specific area the school is known for? (I'm really interested in the research carried out by the PENSA group). 

Finally, I know some schools will only accept students into their Ph.D. programs if they can fully fund the students. Is that the case for  Princeton?

&gt; We will enroll a small group of exceptionally well-prepared transfer 
&gt; students from a range of backgrounds, and we particularly 
&gt; encourage applications from students from low-income backgrounds, 
&gt; community college students, and U.S. military veterans. 

As a current freshman at USC (1570 SAT, 4.0 GPA), is it worth applying, or will admission essentially be out-of-reach even for relatively well-qualified applicants? (At Harvard, only 13 out of 1400 transfer applicants were accepted last year.) I feel I can demonstrate a passion for my program of interest, which is a blend of cognitive science and philosophy, speak to several aspects of the Princeton culture and campus which make a good fit, and generally make a good case for my admission. If chances are predicted to be near-zero though--especially as I fit into none of the above groups--I'll probably apply elsewhere.

I made a reservation for 6 people at 6:00 and 4 of us arrived on time while the other 2 would be arriving a few minutes late. We informed the front desk that we arrived and had a reservation. They looked up my name in the system and confirmed our reservation. They then proceeded to show other guests to tables and left us standing there. We had to go back over to them and ask that we be seated. This was very odd. 

When we got seated we had a wonderful waitress who was very engaging, but who mistakenly advised my whole party that the Sangria along with other ""concoctions"" and mixed drinks were included in the happy hour at the bar that was ending at 6:30. A few of us went up to the bar to order half price sangrias for the six of us. They poured each glass and set them in front of us and then gave us the check where we noticed they were not rung up for half price. We told the bartender and she informed us that they were not included in the happy hour. We explained that we had been explicitly told by our waitress that they were included and if they were not part of the happy hour then we didnt want them. The bartender called over the manager Chad who had earlier left us standing in the lobby waiting to be seated after confirming our party had arrived. He explained again that it wasnt part of the happy hour and that there was nothing he could do so we said we didnt want them. At this point the ""right"" thing to do was to have given us the sangrias at half price because now the poured drinks were just going to go to waste and they might as well get the $6 for them instead of being out the $12 for each glass.

BUT that was not the case because Chad told the bartender to pour the glasses of Sangria back into the large tub of sangria to be served again! Right in front of us the bartender told Chad that you are not allowed to do that but he replied with ""Yes I can"" and proceeded to scoop out the ice from each glass and pour all the sangria back into the serving container to be served again! If this is going on right in front of customers then what is going on behind the scenes at this restaurant!? You CANNOT serve something to a customer and then re-serve it to another!

I'm going to be a grad student at Pton in the fall, but I kind of wanted to gauge the culture before going so I knew what to expect. The place I did my undergrad in was located in a college-town where the 70s culture never really left. There are a lot of hippie-dippie leanings and the town is small, inclusive, and definitely focused on the arts/entertainment at large (outside of the university).

I know that Princeton is also a college-town, but I've heard that it's definitely more ""old money"" and Gatsby-esque in some ways. I've never really seen income disparity at my undergrad school, but I've heard that the spectrum is a little more visible at Princeton. Can anyone speak to this?

Also, I'm sure that there is definitely some aspect of fiscal conservatism at Princeton (I grew up a few towns over, I know what it's like), but is Princeton socially-liberal? I'm not expecting the same kind of hippie-freedom that my undergrad school's town had, but it would be comforting to know that Princeton culture isn't too judgmental. I know that art and entertainment play a big role in the culture there, too, but it feels more ""prestige-driven"", as it were, as opposed to art for arts sake? Idk how to explain it. Maybe if y'all came to where I go to undergrad you'd see what I meant, haha.

This summer we are going on tour to all lower 48 states and finding people along the way to complete freedom cards.

0.0,1492910529.0,7.0,princeton,"Hi,

So I'm going to be a graduate student over at Pton next year, and I was wondering if I could ask a couple of questions about piano lessons on/near campus.

I've been playing continuously since 2005, but I never really cared much to practice until I started college and became more serious about what I did in my free time. Basically, I had formal lessons from 2005 until I left for college a few years ago, but I've been mostly just playing stuff by myself without any guidance for the last couple of years, since I go to school in a pretty remote location in upstate NY and it's hard to find people to teach piano here.

When I come back to civilization next year, I am hoping to actually have someone guide me so I don't develop bad posture/fingerings. Does anybody have recommendations for either teachers or places that I should look for around the Princeton area for a student like me with some experience already? Are teachers around the area usually only kid-focused?

I would like to know a bit more before making my final decision. I plan on visiting the campus in March during my spring break and seeing what it's like.

I was wondering if someone (preferably current or former MSE in CS students) could tell me more about this program. I have some more specific questions below about the thesis-track version of the program:

 * What are the research opportunities like? Is it easy to continue onto a PhD (at Princeton or elsewhere) from the MSE program? I am a pretty weak student coming out of undergrad in terms of research/GPA, so I'd like to use this opportunity to showcase improved academics and a better research portfolio when I apply to PhD programs in 2 years.

 * Are you required to do research between the end of your first year and the beginning of your second year? Or did you do a tech/fintech internship instead?

 * What kind of classes did you have to take? I went to another top-10 school for undergrad, so I think a lot of the classes may be of comparable quality (e.g. we have an equivalent of COS 326 at my undergrad school with some of the same assignments, like Moogle). So I feel like I would want to take classes that I haven't already done in undergrad. Did you get to take anything interesting, or was it mostly focused on your specialization within CS?

 * Can you combine disciplines? I'm interested at the intersection of PL and computer architecture (approximate computing and new hardware/software models to support the new paradigm). Is it easy to find advisors willing to work a little out of their comfort zones to accommodate unusual interests, or are people more traditional?

 * Where did you look for housing? As it happens, I grew up around the area, so I know about the happening areas (I used to frequent Hoagie Haven back in high school). My parents live in Kendall Park (which borders Princeton and is literally off of Route 27, about 10 minutes away). I could live with them, but the stipend makes it possible for me to live on/off-campus in an apartment or something. Do y'all have any recommendations?

 * Did you come to Princeton MSE from another undergrad or did you just continue from Princeton undergrad? If you're from somewhere else, can you talk about what it is like to adjust to the Princeton academic climate?

 * Are all the MSE students close? Did you find it easy to make friends/get involved despite being possibly new to the school? Do you feel like it's easy to have fun, or is it a lot more serious than undergrad?

So sorry about all the questions! I'm really excited, and I'd like to know more about the school.

I have no doubts at all as to the quality of the education he's receiving at PTS, but as far as I understand, it's not a part of Princeton University in any meaningful way, and the admissions process is totally different.  He will talk about Princeton sports, student life, etc. as if he goes to the University, and it's starting to grate on me a bit, since it just feels like he is willfully deceiving people.  Since I don't go there, I guess I have no reason to really be all that bothered, but I'm wondering if Princeton University students regard PTS students as Princeton students or part of the Princeton community.

I have pretty good grades in CIE A-levels. Got A*, A*, B, and A in Physics, Math, Chemistry, and General Paper. As far as standarized tests go, I have taken TOEFL (117/120), and I am taking ACT on October 22. As of now, I get 34-ish score on practice tests, and I am working to bring that up to a 35. On November 5, I am sitting for 3 SAT Subject Tests: Physics, Math 2, and Chemistry. 800s are practically possible on all three. 

Great Recommendation letters. 

Co-curriculuars: Participated in International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2015, but didn't win anything so I don't think it will boost my application. Apart from National Astronomy Olympiads, made the final round of National Physics Olympiad but couldn't make the final team. Again, since I from a small country, olympiads are not all that competitive as in US or China. So I fear colleges will consider these with all seriousness. 

Extra-curriculars: Debated in a bunch of national level debate contests. Won some. Named 'one of the best debaters' in two. In school's debate team and quiz team. Good performances in some national contests. 

Founded and lead a much needed 'public speaking club' in school. 

Other than these, some volunteering activities and some works. Certainly not as impressive as some kids in College Confidential do.

Stereotypes have given me a little hesitance about Princeton, despite how silly they might me. So I guess my questions just are -What is the atmosphere? Are there ways to balance academic rigor with fun campus life? Are you having fun?  Is it very elitist, pretentious? Does the competitive atmosphere create a kind of ""Where fun goes to die"" like UChicago? How preppy is it? Do you feel like you can be yourself? Most of all, do you like it?

0.0,1462310639.0,3.0,princeton,"Hi guys. Basically I didn't do too well in freshman and sophomore year in high school because of I was quite sick (in and out of the hospital constantly, make-shift clean-room in my room. that kind of fun stuff). Luckily I've gotten better and I'm doing better in school. Currently, I am a senior and for my junior and senior year I have a pretty good GPA (4.9/5) in heavy course load (5 semesters worth of credit in some colleges). I've decided to take a gap year and apply next year so I can show Princeton a bit more of myself. However, what I'm wondering is what direction of work do you think would be better. I'm a lib-arts guy but I enjoy math a lot so I thought maybe I could take some more advanced mathematics courses (multivariable calc or statistics) and some other courses like that. However, I'm also working on a couple of things such as a podcast I do once a week (which surprisingly a single 2 hour episode requires at least 15 hours of research, prep and editing to be decent so it's quite a bit of work). I'm also doing this internship which will be full time once school is over.

What would you recommend I focus on? I mean I can do both but obviously they'll both take a bit of a hit. Personally, I prefer to focus on my projects but I totally understand universities want to see more than 2 years of good academics. Any advice on this matter?

To any student who is still deciding between Princeton and elsewhere, I would like to give you my thoughts about Princeton and the college decision process.

I write this in part because I wish someone had told me these things when I was deciding, and also (admittedly) as a way for me to get my thoughts out of head.

I write this anonymously because I do not want people to remember me as that guy who ranted on the class of 2020 page. But if I could, this is what I would write on that page:


People will rarely tell you what is wrong with their college. You can ask, but they won't give you an honest answer. I know this because , as a prefrosh, I asked tons of current students about things they didn't like about here, and they rarely would give me a straight answer.

I have noticed that when students decide where they are attending, they gain this cult-like affinity for their college, refusing to believe other colleges could have possibly been a better choice. This is somewhat understandable, because people are generally trying to justify to themselves that they made the right choice, but on occasion it creates a fairly negative environment (like the Princeton Class of 20XY pages)

**The students on the class page are not representative of the college** 

The students on the class page are generally the more naive, outgoing people out there.

**Princeton has problems**

Upper classmen dining is socioeconomically stratified. The eating clubs are the rich and upper-middle students, independents are middle income students whose parents are making them pay through college, meal planners are generally the full-financial aid poor kids. As a kid from a poor background, this disgusts me.


**I made the wrong choice coming here**

If all financial aid were equal, I would be Harvey Mudd right now. If I attended there with the aid they offered me I would have had to go into debt, whereas here I got effectively full financial aid. I still wonder if going to HMC would have been worth the debt. Sometimes I wonder if another college that I got equal aid from would have been better as well.

**Students who do not like it here are isolated**

I have a small friend group that is connected simply by the fact that we don't love it here, and I can honestly say we all feel some level of isolation simply because we aren't apart of this group who LOVES it here.

**Yes, this campus is pretty. That doesn't matter as much as you think**

After waking up feeling like burntout shit for the fortieth night in a row, the beauty starts going over your head.


**Social life is homogenous**

If you don't find yourself attracted to either the eating club culture or the VERY specific type of ""alternative culture"" the Alternative (non-drinking) groups bring on campus, you will be hard pressed to find social situations you will strive in. 

People have gotten defensive when I simply *implied* I didn't love it here, as if me not liking it here affected them personally.


**Prestige is (mostly) meaningless**

If you would be successful here, chances are you'd be successful at a state school as well. This is with few concessions (such as jobs in finance). **You will forget what the name ""Princeton"" felt like when you got in. It will be replaced with normalcy**


**Culture is uppermiddle class here**

People act upper middle class, even if they aren't. People feel fake. People aren't directly competitive, but we *all* know we are competing for the same opportunities. However ambiguous this term is: ""fakeness"" is ubiquitous here.


**Fuck your parents**

If your parents are pressuring you to Princeton due to what it will mean for the family name, they aren't being good parents.

**Money does matter**

I feel isolated because I was poor as a kid here. Princeton DOES do a good job of making me feel well off here. They gave me a top-of-the-line laptop, an iPad, and financial aid. *I am eternally grateful for this*. But I still feel isolated. People talk about being ""broke"" because they spent too much going shopping at Sperry's. Someone once said I looked homeless behind my back because my shoes had a hole in them and I was wearing some well-worn jeans. Wealth is pervasive here.

**There is a competitive culture here, it just isn't explicit**


I could go on, but I feel like I am already rambling on. I am certain this is hard to follow but I hope it is helpful to someone.

**To conclude:** Let me be clear here-- a LOT of people do like it here, but they are generally who you are hearing from on the class of 2020 page and whatnot. My point is, the people who do not love it are generally silent because they feel isolated enough as is.

I was invited or contacted, whichever you prefer, for a college interview for Princeton in very early January, with the actual interview having taken place on January 4th. I had submitted my Princeton application on December 13th and was seemingly contacted immediately after the turn of the year on January 2nd. Is this coincidental? I am asking because I saw another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/43e683/international_applicant_invited_for_an_interview/) on this subreddit that was about an international application who had questions regarding the interview about what to expect. One person [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/43e683/international_applicant_invited_for_an_interview/czhqhxo), and I quote:

&gt;The thing is given that you got an interview, it means you are already a **qualified applicant**, and they are looking for qualified applicants that are ""interesting"", ie seem motivated, engaging, and well, actually interested in going to Princeton.

Is that the reason why I was contacted so quickly for an interview?

Im doing the first year which is common to all science and engineering and still cannot decide wether I should study Mechanical Engineering or Physics. Some background on how degrees work here in Argentina: Physics degree has an estimated duration of 7 years, It has everything Physics and a lot of laboratories. As well as a Thesis on the last year. In the US its probably considered as a bachelors and a little more. The mechanical engineering degree has an estimated duration of six years. Also the last year you have an option of a Thesis. 

Anyways, Im planning on continuing my education. I really like them both and lately I have been thinking of doing ""both"". Like for example Physics here, then study abroad and get a masters in mechanical engineering and a Phd in either mechanical/aerospace engineering or Physics. 

Which degree do you think it will be better? Considering the duration. Also, If I study mechanical engineering firstly I will get a lot of skills which would allow me to live a really good life here in Argentina so if I for some reason change my mind I would have that backup plan.

I was looking at some Princeton admission pages and it said that their utmost priority is the ""rigor of Secondary school record"". The internet has conflicting info on this. Does this mean how much you challenged yourself and how many of the hardest courses you took, or does this mean how difficult your high school is? If applicant A comes from fancy private school with about normal to fairly rigorous record, and applicant B comes from normal public high school, and took the most challenging courses (Which may or may not be more than student A due to the courses offered at their school), who would get admitted? I am essentially trying to figure out if I am at a disadvantage by going to a local public high school that is near by.

We'll also have programming classes for kids, workshops, and a mini-maker faire for hardware aficionados.

Anyone can participate; you don’t have to be a developer or tech expert, you just have to care about your neighborhood and community. 

Stop by anytime from noon to midnight on Saturday June 6, and 8-noon on Sunday, June 7. There will be free meals and swag for attendees!

Registration is open through our website: www.codeforprinceton.org.

1) As a prospective premed student, the majors seem a little limited compared to Cornell, for example EEB or Molecular Bio. Will this affect me in any significant way?

2) The idea of a thesis seems intimidating yet cool at the same time. How helpful were the faculty in helping write the thesis and overall how difficult is it?

3) A lot of people are telling me to not come here because it is ""preppy."" Understanding that this is mostly a myth, how easy is it for your average middle-class student to fit in?

4) This question is about the grading system: How does it work exactly? And does the attempt to curb inflation help or hinder students?

5) How are the opportunities for extracurriculars like research or volunteering on and off campus? Given the relative proximity to NYC compared to Cornell, how feasible is it to do something in NYC on weekends perhaps?

6) What are your opinions on the dorming system?

I am visiting on Sunday to get more of a feel of the campus and environment there, which will surely help me decide. Thanks guys, I would really appreciate your opinions.",Some questions from a prospective freshman undergraduate - would appreciate answers soon.,t3_365y61,8.0,1.0

0.0,1608688504.0,34.0,yale,"TLDR: Admitted to Yale and had three major questions.

* STEM majors, how has it been learning at a school that's known for focusing on humanities?
* How has your experience in the New Haven area been?
* Is there a ""superiority"" complex among students with regards to Harvard? That's the vibe I've gotten from admitted students chats so far.

Hey everyone! I was accepted to Yale REA and think I'll commit soon. It's my dream school and I can't see myself anywhere else. But, I wanted to see if anyone on this sub could help inform me before I make a final decision.

Firstly, I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to major in, but I know it will be in either chemistry or biology. As of now, I'm probably doing Molecular Biophysics &amp; Biochemistry. But, I have no clue what I want to do as a career, and wouldn't be surprised if I decided to switch to an Econ or Data Science/Stats major. The thing I liked about Yale was the ability to easily switch majors, I know some schools are tough since you have to transfer between colleges, but that's not the case at Yale.

Yale is also a very humanities-heavy school, but from what I've read, it's been pouring A LOT into improving its STEM programs. I don't see this as a large issue, since I enjoy humanities as much as STEM, just can't see myself majoring in anything non-STEM. The reason I didn't apply to a school like MIT is b/c I value the importance of a liberal arts education that Yale provides. Yale seems like a great school for general science (biology, physics, chem, etc. which I hope to do). It also seems like there are endless opportunities for research which interest me as well. Could anyone that's majoring in STEM talk about their experiences?

Finally, more general stuff. How's New Haven? Do you find yourself stuck in a ""Yale bubble"" or do you get the chance to explore? Do you connect with students from surrounding colleges at all?

I really love what I can tell about the community, etc, and part of me wants to stop applying to other colleges and commit.

The financial aid was great, so that’s not a concern. My family wants me to commit as well.

The “problem” (extremely good problem to have, I almost feel bad even worrying about an acceptance to YALE) is that I’m a STEM student. I don’t really know what I wanna do with my life, but I’ve gone to a STEM high school and that is more than likely what I’ll end up majoring in. I do have interests outside of math/science, and loved the idea of getting to know a variety of people in Yale residential colleges and having a liberal arts education. However, everything I’ve read says Yale isn’t that strong in STEM. 

I know at this caliber (for undergrad especially?) the distinctions of the relative strengths of the fields aren’t THAT relevant, but I keep feeling like I might be ill advised not trying for Stanford and Princeton (as a potential engineering student) even though I like Yale more... do any STEM students at Yale have something to say about the strength of stem, why you chose Yale as a stem student, etc? Also, how are the graduate school prospects in STEM from Yale, as compared to a more heavily STEM school? 

Again, I know this is dumb. Yale is amazing, fit is the most important thing, etc, etc, I’m just stressed about it and would love to hear from Yalies in this kind of situation.

I know many in CS poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons I'm happy to get into if asked, I'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

My interests in CS lie primarily in machine learning (more because I have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security. If any of you are CS graduate students involved in these fields, I'd love to know your experience with the program. If not, I'd still love to hear your thoughts. 

Yale being Yale, I'm a little concerned about how master's students are treated as opposed PhD students when it comes to academic mentorship and opportunities. I've hear horror stories (not necessarily from Yale, but from similar big-name CS schools) of PhD advisors. I'm also coming from a ""no-name"" state school, and I'm a little intimated by the Ivys. Are my fears overblown?

For context, here are the other schools I'm looking at (and a fair warning, this list is way too long and part of the reason I'm looking for feedback is to help trim down this list): KTH, ETH Zurich, EPFL, Stanford, University of Michigan, CMU, Princeton, Cornell, Penn, University of Wisconsin, University of British Columbia, Oxford University, Cambridge University, Harvard University, McGill University, Kings College London.",Why Yale for a CS master's?,t3_i9bh8k,7.0,0.89

I was accepted tonight as a transfer to Yale!! I am very excited as when I applied the first time it was my first choice. However, I feel as though my life/ priorities have changed significantly since that point in time. I spent the past year on a leave of absence from my college pursuing my professional acting and recorded music careers, which have both made me happier than I've ever been. I decided to transfer from my previous institution because there was no artistic community / available courses in acting/playwriting/recorded music, and it was too far away from LA auditions (2-2.5 hours 1 way). I was also accepted to Columbia University (a school that I have more friends at and am way more acquainted with) and am now tasked with the difficult decision between the two. If I was at Yale, would I feasibly be able to continue auditioning in NYC with my agency and not have to put my career on pause for 3 years? At Yale, would I get stronger connections/ inroads to the industry than at Columbia? Stronger training? Additionally, I've heard nothing about people at Yale pursuing a career in recorded (pop) music. Is there a community of non-classical musicians/producers on campus?  Any advice is appreciated!! If you have any insight as to Yale's integration of transfer students that would be helpful too. Thank you, and sorry for the long post.

I’m hoping to do a phd after undergrad, and am especially interested in QFT and string theory. I recently noticed that Yale doesn’t really have any relativity (only intro to special in 410, and no general) courses for undergrads. MIT + other schools seem to have a general relativity, as well as an intro to string theory, course for undergrads, and I was wondering if entering grad school without these would be an issue. 

Should I consider ditching the double major and trying to take grad-level physics courses to make up? Is this fairly accessible and/or commonly done? 

On the other hand, I’ve heard many math classes - complex analysis, topology, differential geometry, partial diffeqs, Lie groups, functional analysis - are recommended/essential for theoretical physics. I’m also curious about the “math for physics” courses, could these supplement or replace any of the above to make room for grad courses?

0.0,1587748235.0,20.0,yale,"Edit: thanks for all the advice, I decided to commit to Stanford

Hi everyone! I was extremely lucky to be admitted to both of these great schools. I've been agonizing over this decision for the last month and still haven't come to a final decision. There are things I love and dislike about both schools, and I think I would be happy at either. I'll try my best to outline what I see to be the advantages and disadvantages of Stanford vs. Yale in Academics, Student Experience, and Career Outcomes as they relate to my interests and goals- please correct me if you disagree with any of my assessments and lmk if you have relevant info/experiences!

**Academics:** *I am interested in Analytic Philosophy and CS/logic. Right now, I think I want to study both of these fields in college, but I am very open to exploring new areas.*

* Obviously, the overall quality of education is pretty much the same at both of these schools.
* Stanford’s strengths and resources are tilted towards STEM, while Yale’s are tilted towards the humanities. The majors I’m interested in at each school are Symbolic Systems at Stanford and Math + Philosophy at Yale. Both of these programs seem like they leverage their school’s institutional strengths well.
* At Stanford, it looks like it’s much easier to get a master’s degree with your bachelor’s in 4 years, which is something I would like to do. (thinking of Symsys BS with CS coterm)
* At Yale, it seems easier to double major than at Stanford, which isn’t too important to me, but I would want to do this if I can’t get a master’s degree.
* Both schools have grade inflation, but it looks like inflation is more prevalent at Yale.

**Student Experience/Culture:** *I grew up in the south and attended high school at an elite prep school in the northeast. I'm looking for a new, exciting college experience that pushes me to challenge myself and grow*

* Stanford has better weather and a more exciting location in SV. A lot more appealing to me than crime-ridden, cold, economically depressed New Haven
* Yale might have a friendlier, more open social scene due to residential colleges, as opposed to Stanford, which I’ve heard is cliquey.
* It seems like Stanford is less elitist/stuffy, which I see as a refreshing departure from my high school experience.
* I feel like I might fit in better socially at Stanford as an Asian dude who's not from an elite family.
* My impression is that Stanford's culture is more pre-professional than Yale's, which I appreciate.
* I don't like how Stanford seems very STEM-dominated, especially as someone whose primary interest lies outside of the natural sciences. Yale seems to have more diversity of academic interests, which I like.

**Career Outcomes:** *I’m not sure what I want to do as a career, but I’ll probably either go into Consulting/Tech/Finance or off to Law School (like most people at these schools lmao)*

* Name Brand- virtually the same overall (will open most of the same doors), but my impression is Stanford fares better on the west coast and internationally, while Yale’s brand is stronger on the east coast.
* It seems to me that Stanford, being a younger school, doesn’t have the same deep roots that Yale does in fields dominated by old money / HYP, such as Wall Street and Politics
* Yale’s network is stronger in Wall Street, Government, and Law, while Stanford’s network is stronger in High Tech, VC, and Business.
* Yale’s alumni are largely concentrated in NYC, and Stanford’s alumni are mostly in the Bay Area. I can see myself working in either area.

Overall, I think Stanford and Yale will serve me equally well academically and in my future career. Based on the school cultures/expected student experience, I'm leaning towards Stanford right now b/c of its better location, more down-to-earth students, and the exciting prospect of moving away from what I'm used to in the northeast.

I was just seeing if you guys have any advice as well as answers to a few questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

First off, how much stock should I even be putting into the fact I got an interview in the first place? I want to be excited because, from what I've seen, they handpick people for it but I can't find a good source to confirm that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, what would the 'tone' of the interview be? I did one with Harvard a few days ago and it was a really friendly interview with a pretty wide range of questions (personal life, background, academic/non-academic interests, future plans, why 'X' school, etc.). Is it safe to say it will be pretty similar? 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, in my spare time, I read a LOT of works that have to do with the topic I'm hoping to major in (Global Affairs) and I try to stick to respected scholars and publications. I'm honestly just a massive nerd for the subject and I enjoy reading about it constantly. Assuming that it's something relevant to the questions being asked, would it seem too 'try-hard' to bring this up? I really am the type of person who uses their free time to read books by academics, but I don't want to talk about it if it makes me come across as inauthentic or that I believe that I know it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear YSM Faculty:

In follow-up to recent communications from President Salovey, Provost Strobel, and me, basic science chairs and directors convened today to discuss the meaning of critical or essential work in the laboratory setting. As the situation on-the-ground around COVID evolves, so must our definition of critical and essential functions in the laboratory.

As always, the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and patients are our priority.

At this time, examples of critical laboratory work include research on the causes and mechanisms of viral (COVID-19) infection; therapeutic clinical research studies; monitoring of the safety and efficacy of patients in ongoing clinical trials; testing of patient/research samples for ongoing clinical trials that cannot be paused; and other lab work that impacts the immediate safety and health of our patients and community. Preservation of precious resources such as cell lines or animals so as to avoid the disruption of months or years of work may also be viewed as critical, in which case specific team members should be identified to maintain these resources and complete critical experiments.

Investigators or lab members should not come to work if they are having symptoms, and all should practice social distancing. It is important to note that investigators can be very productive while working from home. Some have expressed concerns about the impact of decreased productivity on their life’s work and career development; please know that the university and YSM will be developing a policy to extend the tenure clock commensurate with the duration of interruptions.

More detailed information regarding human subjects research can be viewed here.

\-  When spring recess ends and through April 5 at the earliest, classes will be held using Zoom, Canvas, or other online tools. I know classes take many forms across the university, so this shift to online teaching and learning raises many questions. Deans will be communicating with their faculty and students to provide further details in the days ahead. 

\-  We are asking Yale College students to remain at home after spring recess. For undergraduates who are on campus now, please make every effort to return home as soon as possible, and no later than Sunday, March 15. Yale College Dean Marvin Chun will be providing additional details in the coming days. Undergraduates will have the support of the university in meeting their academic requirements remotely while at home. I understand that some undergraduates consider New Haven to be their home or cannot leave the university at this time. The Yale College Dean’s Office will provide separate instructions for these students, who also will take their classes online.

Graduate and professional students are encouraged to remain off-campus and participate in online instruction, unless required to be on campus due to the nature of their research or academic programs. More information is forthcoming from the deans of each school.

0.0,1571410597.0,5.0,yale," For the [**sixth semester in a row**](https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/Yale-says-sexual-misconduct-complaints-increase-14456597.php), sexual misconduct reports have gone up at Yale University, [**double the number**](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/) from spring 2017.

And the Yale official responsible for compiling the report seems to regard these rising numbers as a positive development.

“We are hopeful that the increase in complaints reported to the University is an indication that our community is more aware of and more frequently accessing our resources,” Stephanie Spangler, Title IX coordinator and deputy provost for health affairs and academic integrity, told the [***Yale Daily News***](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/)*.*

Some of those analyzing the [**recent semi-annual report**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Sexual%20Misconduct%20Report%20Jan-Jun%202019.pdf) are skeptical of the high numbers, however, largely due to the broad definitions for terms such as sexual harassment and sexual assault.

With 169 claims filed from January through June alone, the Ivy League school would have a “much higher violent crime rate than any of the nation’s most dangerous cities” if the report is to be believed, Brooklyn College Prof. KC Johnson, who chronicles Title IX enforcement at colleges nationwide, wrote in a recent analysis.

The broad definitions have real consequences for students’ rights, according to Samantha Harris, vice president for procedural advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

“By giving the impression that the university is a hotbed of violent sexual crimes,” she told*The College Fix* in an email, “a broad definition like this fosters the type of climate of fear that has led to the wholesale abandonment of due process in campus sexual misconduct adjudications. It also trivializes real sex crimes.”

Yale did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls from *The Fix* Oct. 8-14, asking for its response to Johnson’s analysis of the report, published in [***Minding the Campus***](https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2019/10/04/is-yale-more-dangerous-than-detroit/).

***‘Counseling’ is the common response to sexual misconduct***

Johnson is a [**recurring critic**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/yales-latest-report-on-its-sexual-misconduct-investigations-shows-more-curiosities/) of the so-called Spangler reports. He noted that despite the huge number of reported cases, “only five sexual assault cases were adjudicated” during the most recent six-month period.

Four of the five accused students were found guilty, yet the punishments – including short suspensions or probation – “suggest the actual offense was far less severe than the commonly understood definition of sexual assault,” he wrote.

Johnson also pointed out that Spangler has “removed more and more details from her reports” over the years, including details of “third-party reports involving anonymous alleged victims and accused students.”

The report, released in mid-September, is the 16th since 2012. It covers sexual misconduct reports to Yale Title IX coordinators, the Yale Police Department, and the [**University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct**](https://provost.yale.edu/uwc/procedures) for the first six months of the calendar year.

The half-year report, like its predecessors, “illustrates the danger of lumping everything from groping to forcible rape under the umbrella term ‘sexual assault,’” said Harris, whose work with FIRE concerns issues of free speech and due process on campus.

“If one reads the report, one sees that the university commonly responds to reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault simply by ‘counsel\[ing\] the respondent on appropriate conduct’ — including in response to reports of penetration without consent!” she told *The Fix*, highlighting pages 10 and 11 of the report:

&gt;If counseling respondents is truly the university’s response to rape, that is grossly inadequate — but what I suspect this actually reflects is the university’s use of an ambiguous and confusing “affirmative consent” definition, under which sex is not consensual unless there is “positive, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement to engage in specific sexual activity throughout a sexual encounter,” which must be re-affirmed for each new sexual act and which can be “revoked at any time.”

Harris argues that definitions such as these are “likely to engender a great deal of confusion among participants in sexual encounters.”

After New York approved an [**affirmative consent law**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/law-professors-line-up-against-new-yorks-new-campus-sexual-assault-law/) that applies only to colleges, FIRE [**interviewed local students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/) about it, Harris noted, learning that “they found the definition highly confusing and were uncertain about what was now prohibited.

“In light of these broad definitions, it is perhaps not surprising that Yale has been the subject of at least 6 lawsuits brought by students accused of sexual misconduct,” she said, “alleging they were denied a fair process in their on-campus judicial proceedings.”

**MORE**: [**New York affirmative consent law baffles students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/)

***Yale more dangerous for female grad students than for undergrads?***

Further analysis of the report shows that 146 of the misconduct claims went to the Title IX office, which handles informal resolution, while only seven went to the university-wide committee, which actually adjudicates complaints.

The average age of reporting students has risen, both at Yale and nationally, according to Johnson. He attributes this trend to older students having attended college in an “accuser-friendly Title IX environment.”

If valid, this trend would indicate that Yale “becomes more dangerous for female students as they age out of the 18-24-year-old cohort.”

In the Yale cohort of the Association of American Universities’ 2015 “[**climate survey**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/WestatReportYaleUniversity-1.pdf)” on sexual assault and misconduct, 16.1 percent of Yale students reported they had experienced an attempted or completed act of sexual misconduct. Spangler is one of the credited designers of this [**national survey**](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/%40%20Files/Climate%20Survey/AAU_Campus_Climate_Survey_12_14_15.pdf), which will release 2019 results later this year.

Yale might not be alone in the Ivy League when it comes to a spike in reported sexual misconduct.

Last week Harvard University announced the debut of an anonymous Title IX reporting form, following apparent interest from the student body. It will allow students to submit Title IX complaints against anyone at Harvard with no trace back to themselves.

[***The Harvard Crimson***](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/8/title-ix-anonymous/#.XZycnWshBfU.twitter) notes that the rollout “follows the Government Department Committee on Climate Change’s recommendation that Harvard institute an anonymous reporting system in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez.”

Asked if he saw a connection between the new Harvard reporting system and the high number of complaints at Yale, Johnson told *The Fix* in an email that the two situations weren’t connected but rather “problematic for their own reasons.”

“Harvard raises issues \[because\] it allows anonymous complaints by witnesses \[with an\] explicit statement that the \[accused\] party won’t learn of the allegation,” he said. In an aside, Johnson said Harvard’s system “is already less fair than Yale’s, which is saying something.”

The core problem with Yale’s system is the “extremely broad definition of sexual assault” combined with Spangler’s practice of “leaving readers with the implication that all of these allegations have been adjudicated and upheld, even though only a tiny percentage of them are,” he said.

i’m a first year still figuring out my course schedule and i have narrowed it down to a few options. 

Thus far, I have only really decided on the following three courses:

Calc 115 ( calc 2) 
Chem 174 ( First year orgo) 
Chem 222La ( lab for organic chem) 
The History of World History ( First year seminar)

I am having difficulty choosing my fourth course. i want something that is easy considering how hard the rest of my schedule is. 

My current contenders are the following: 

Fren130 ( L30 french with Ruth Koizim) 
Econ 110 ( seminar of intro to microeconomics) 
Econ 115 ( into to microeconomics) 
Bio 101 ( intro to bio) 

i don’t want to take french this semester because of how hard the professor makes the course sound; in addition to meeting everyday, Koizim proudly declared that she would be assigning 90-120 minutes of homework every night, which i feel would be too much considering my other classes. 

I have heard that it is better to take Bio during the off cycle. 

Anyway, i would love to hear your thoughts on what my fourth course should be. i want to have a schedule that would keep me busy but also allow me time to have a social life and delve into extracurricular activities.

While I am attracted to the proximity with some of Yale’s best professors, the seminar learning environment, and the close knit community that DS platforms, I just don’t feel very interested by the summer reading and have been bored to death by the Iliad. My academic interests, as of now, lean more towards the history and literature of MENA and south east asia and the legacy of colonialism. That is not to say that i plan on avoiding the classics through my undergraduate career though.  I also feel hesitant to dive into what seems to be a rigorous program during my first year at Yale when I would rather be gathering my bearings and investing time into my social life.

I worry, however, that by not doing DS i wouldn’t be availing the best of what yale has to offer and that i would miss out on a community of DS students that’d make for some wonderful friends. Also, it seems that ex DSers are particularly well represented in programs such as the Brady-Johnson grand strategy program and selective majors, so i worry that if i decide not to DS i will be at a disadvantage and a weaker student in the eyes of my professors.

Yale does have a great arts program, but it's mostly for graduate school. I talked with an art undergrad student and she said Yale is not great for undergrad art studies. Additionally, when I was there for BDD, there were no visual arts clubs at Yale. I'm between Yale and Stanford and I don't really like one over the other.

I never ate alone, even in dining halls where I didn’t know anyone. Some Yalies would always take pity on me and invite me to sit with them. 

My hosts were amazing, but I found plenty of wonderful Yalies while sitting in common rooms or in classrooms or on park benches as well. Students would recognize the BDD bracelet on my wrist and introduce themselves to me and offer to talk to me about my major or show me around. 

Even more than being kind, every Yalie I met was thoughtful and non-judgmental, even when I was nervous and stuttering through the day. Not every conversation was about quantum physics or objective morality, but I walked away from every conversation having learned something new. Even better, I felt like the Yalies I talked to wanted to listen and learn from me too.

I heard FOOT is the most popular and that it fosters very intimate and long term bonds, which I love. It also sounds super fun. The bad thing is that it costs a bit and I won't get financial aid to cover it, and beyond the upfront $460 i would also need to purchase most of the equipment on the packing list (even though they say to just borrow things, no one I know is a big fan of hiking, so I can't).

I am willing to foot (no pun intended) the cost of FOOT if it is truly worth it over the other programs. 

On the other hand, it seems like Harvest is less popular. I've heard less about it and I don't even know the costs associated, but I love taking care of animals/animal husbandry and I'd love to experience farm life. I don't know if it fosters the same intimate connection that FOOT does though.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, this reads as an under-handed journalistic work. The   
report overly represents people who deem the Executive order to be   
""over-reaching."" Only one student is presented as a supporter of the   
Executive order. It also seems that there's a delusion on this campus   
that freedom of speech should be concerned about not making students   
uncomfortable. This is preposterous! Yale is supposed to be a space of   
intellectualism, where you face challenges from people with opposing   
views (yes, those views can make you uncomfortable), and draw your own. I  
 am very curious to find out how many students support the Executive   
order. If the YDN is curious too, it should send out a survey!

For activities, I am currently in a small orchestra at Brown and I am starting to run a magazine by myself. (I am also participating in a Christan fellowship group. However, this does not count anything.)

I applied to Yale as a freshman last year but got rejected. I was admitted by Tufts University and RISD and some other art schools.

I want to ask about the atmosphere at Yale since it is near impossible for me to actually visit American colleges regularly. This is going to be somewhat long, so bear with me, please!

I'm not sure what I want to major in yet, but currently, I have an interest in medicine and want to become a doctor (pathologist) someday. My counselor is recommending biology. However, I also love writing, doing research and studying non-science subjects, such as comparative politics and literature as well. I genuinely enjoy every subject I take except for Korean history. Students like me have trouble studying in the Korean curriculum because, starting from sophomore year, Korean students are forced to pick either a science curriculum or a non-science curriculum. This is the main reason why I wanted to study abroad.

I got the idea that even though Yale offers great science courses like MCDB, it emphasizes the arts and humanities. I yearn to take courses in literature, writing, and perhaps politics as well when I'm in college. Schools like MIT, Caltech, or Princeton, even though they are absolutely amazing (no doubt), doesn't really seem right for me because they are more science-orientated. Also, I'm tired of competing with everyone I study with. The Korean education system is extremely competitive, and kids fail to go into the college of their choice because they make a mistake or get one more question wrong in their school tests. This causes enmity and exasperation for everyone. I don't mind a little competition, but I want to study in an environment where people are willing to help each other and are less competitive or greedy.

First of all, is the atmosphere I'm picturing above accurate? If not, which schools in the US fit this picture? This is really important in making my college choice.

Second, does Yale care less for the science students compared to the humanities?

Third, Does Yale offer a lot of research opportunities for science majoring undergrads? I'm asking this because lots of US unis tend to focus more on graduate students.

Last, a lot of people say my ethnicity give me an advantage because lots of Asians have good stats. I have no idea if this is true. Based on your experience, what is an acceptable stat for an Asian female Yalie?

Only two people have gotten in Yale in our school so far, and it is depressing every time someone says nobody can go in because we're Asian. My current stats are sat 1540 (math 800, lang 740), Math 2 800, and three 5s for APs (comparative politics, psychology, micro). Straight As so far, and I am the top of my year. I took bio last weekend, and hopefully, it will be an okay score. I'm retaking SAT I this december. My stats are low because I starting considering studying abroad, and moved to an international school this February. Are my stats THAT BAD?

We do, however, plan to host more AMAs in the future! Follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, or sign up on our email list, to be notified of when our next AMA will take place.* 

MindMap is a New Haven based public education campaign hosted by the Program for Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP). We provide free, local and effective treatment for people who may be experiencing psychosis, as well as support for their families. We are a collaborative program of the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services and the Yale University Department of Psychiatry.

Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. Symptoms can include hallucinations, delusions, increased distractibility and withdrawal.

The goal of our campaign is early intervention. We want to spread awareness about the early warning signs of psychosis, so that people can receive help as soon as possible. First symptoms of psychosis most commonly appear between the ages of 18 and 24, the majority of fist episodes occurring between 13 and 30 years of age.

With this new semester starting, we wanted to give the Yale &amp; New Haven communities the opportunity to ask any questions that they may have about mental health, psychosis, symptoms or treatment. Please leave your questions here and I will be back to answer them. I look forward to chatting with many of you!

I'm a grad student and member of one of the grad schools at Yale. I've noticed that Grad Schools - or at least my one - seem to socially distance themselves from the rest of the university, which is fine, but I was actually hoping to join a club or two to meet people with similar interests beyond my academic study. I don't mind if they're undergrads or other grads (I'm still very early 20s), but I was keen to join some clubs for my interests. 

Thing is, I imagine the undergrads are all exposed to new club/fraternity/social opportunities across the university, but the Grads definitely aren't. There are some specific clubs I'd be really interested in joining, and I'm not sure how I can go about getting on that before it's too late.

I'm an international from the UK who has just moved into Yale. 

I wanted to ask some questions to the community, so thought I would pool them concisely into one post - I hope that's OK! It's a bit of a leap starting up in a new country so these questions might sound dumb, but I just want to make sure I get things right.


1) Is there a good place to buy a bicycle? Ideally a decent second hand bike would be fine. But I'm not sure where to look, particularly for second hands. 

2) Which provider has best phone signal in Yale? I'll mainly be using data for everything (if not Wifi), and I'll mainly be in New Haven, NYC, or Boston for the next few years. So I'm looking for consistent good phone data, and not too pricey. 

3) What bank could people recommend to set up a simple checking account, just to move money in, use it to pay with a card (debit), take cash out, and occasionally receive money? I've seen Bank of America's everywhere - are they user friendly for a simple checking account?


Thanks for all the advice, and sorry if it's all a bit obvious - everything is strange and new for me and your advice is much appreciated.

I've also heard that the placement test is extremely difficult. I reread the Barron's AP Bio book, but apparently much of the placement test material goes beyond the scope of the AP curriculum. How should I go about studying? Thanks!

EDIT Post-Exam: This may have been the most ridiculous exam I've ever taken. The test questions are completely unrelated to the topics the module ostensibly covers. Which isn't to say the questions, if you can even call them that, are difficult conceptually. The content is standard, but the questions just cryptic and meaningless. Often they just make a vague assertion and the impetus is on you justify it. But there's a 2 sentence limit (yes, that's a thing--as if longer, ie. 3 or more sentence, answers are wrong), so you better hope that you read the grader's mind and those 2 sentences were *exactly* what they were looking for because you only get one shot. This whole test is basically an exercise in just Googling random specific things (not necessarily even related to the course material) quickly such that you have enough time to summarize the answer stated explicitly on some random Wikipedia article from 12 sentences into 2 to adhere to the sentence limit and sufficiently obfuscate the content to avoid plagiarism. 30 minutes to do 11 unrelated, arbitrary Google Search summaries, no biology expertise evaluated whatsoever.

I can’t believe this is literally three months after they settled the class action lawsuit about not providing good 401(k) options. What, was that a slap on the wrist? I’ve only looked up one of the fun so far but it’s the index fund and it has .31% fees versus the .02% that the Vanguard fund it is replacing has. Can we *do* something?

Dear MIT 401(k) Plan Participant,

On behalf of MIT, the MIT Supplemental 401(k) Oversight Committee (“Committee”) regularly monitors and reviews the investment options offered in the 401(k) Plan. Recently, the Committee, with the guidance of its investment consultant, has decided to replace nine funds in the Plan with similar plans from the same asset classes. This fund change will occur during the evening of February 22, 2021. You are not required to take any action. The following is an explanation of the change and when it will occur. 

What Funds Will Be Changed?

The following funds will be replaced:

Current Fund to Be Eliminated	Replacement Fund

Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock U.S. Debt Income Fund F

Vanguard Total Stock Market Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock Russell 3000 Index Fund F

Vanguard Value Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Value Fund F

Vanguard Growth Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Growth Fund F

Vanguard Mid‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Mid Capitalization Equity Index Fund F

Vanguard Small‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 2000 Index Fund F

Vanguard US‐Real Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock FTSE EPRA/NARIET U.S. Index Fund F

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock MSCI ACWI ex‐U.S. IMI Index Fund F

Vanguard Emerging‐Markets Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund F

If you have invested in any of the current funds listed above, your investments will be moved automatically to the corresponding replacement fund. Your election to have future contributions invested in any of the current funds will also be automatically changed to the corresponding replacement funds. No action on your part is required.

The replacement funds are very similar to the current funds. They are of the same asset class; invest in many of the same securities; and follow a similar, though slightly different, market index. As always, we encourage all Plan participants to review their 401(k) account allocation regularly to confirm that it continues to be compatible with their retirement savings strategy.

Fact sheets for the new funds will be available in early February on the MIT Human Resources website at https://hr.mit.edu/benefits/401k and will also be posted on Fidelity’s NetBenefits website in late February.

When Is the Fund Change Happening?

The fund transfer will be made during the evening of February 22, 2021. Any fund transfers that you request before 4:00 pm EST on February 22, 2021, will be made before the current funds are replaced. Any of your investments that are automatically transferred to the new funds will be available for you to review on the Fidelity NetBenefits website after 7:00 am EST, February 23, 2021.

Why Are the Funds Being Changed?

The Committee regularly reviews the performance and fees of the investment options in the Plan. As part of this due diligence, it compared certain funds in the Plan to outside options with similar characteristics, evaluating their respective performance, index tracking variance, fund transaction costs and fund management fees. After completing its review, the Committee chose to replace the nine funds described above.

Information from Fidelity

Later this week, Fidelity will send you an announcement with detailed information about the fund changes. Please take the time to read the Fidelity announcement so you are fully informed about the changes taking place.

If you have questions, please contact the Fidelity Benefits Center at 877-648-7283 or MIT Benefits at benefits@mit.edu or 617-253-6151.

Something I was just concerned is that when I’m talking to other adMITs, it seems as if all the Course 18s know each other from math competitions/camps, and I haven’t done those things and I’m not currently part of those communities. And while I’ve studied a lot of university-level math in high school, I feel as if I have a weaker foundation since I feel I haven’t studied mathematics in as much depth as other people — though I guess this is a more minor point because I shouldn’t shy away from math just because it’s intimidating.

I’m also interested in the more applied side of things (rather than something like pure math research) and in particular math’s applications in the natural sciences or CS, so I’m thinking about whether a science major would be a better fit for me (or for CS I might just do 18C).

1. What is the difficulty level (from a beginner’s perspective) and the no of recommended hours per week needed for this course (p-sets, assignments etc)? 
2. Will a basic Python introductory course on Codecademy be a good Segway to start 6.001x?

0.0,1608431351.0,26.0,mit,"To the members of the MIT community,

Following the Goodwin Procter report on MIT’s interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, President Reif asked that I create a process to review its findings about Professor Seth Lloyd and to identify any appropriate action. I created a two-part review and decision-making process with two faculty committees: one to review facts and determine, based on those facts, whether Professor Lloyd violated any MIT policy, and the second to recommend disciplinary action, if necessary. I write today to share the results of this intensive two-stage effort and the decision I have reached. 

Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that I am taking the unusual step of sharing this information with our entire community because of the unique public nature of the case and its impacts. Professor Lloyd knows that I am taking this step, and he understands and accepts that the outcome of this disciplinary process should be shared openly.

The Review Panel

I assembled a panel of five senior faculty leaders from across the Institute and asked them to determine if Professor Lloyd violated MIT policies. The members of the panel were Professor Rohan Abeyaratne, Institute Professor Daron Acemoglu, Institute Professor Penny Chisholm, Materials Science and Engineering Department Head Jeffrey Grossman, and Dean of Science Nergis Mavalvala (chair). The panel members reviewed the Goodwin report as well as other documents they deemed relevant and met with a number of individuals, including the Goodwin fact-finders and Professor Lloyd, several times.  

Based on this review, a majority of the members found that, in connection with donations he received from Epstein in 2012, Professor Lloyd violated MIT’s conflict of interest policy (Policies &amp; Procedures 4.4) by failing to inform MIT that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that, in doing so, he violated MIT’s policy on faculty misconduct (Policies &amp; Procedures 3.4.2). A minority of the members could not conclude one way or the other that his actions violated the conflict of interest policy. 

The full panel further determined that he did not violate any MIT policies in accepting a gift from Epstein in 2005–2006 and a donation in 2017. The panel members did not find that Professor Lloyd tried to circumvent the MIT vetting process nor that he sought to conceal the name of the donor. They did conclude, however, that he failed to reveal crucial information about Epstein’s background to anyone at MIT.

The Evaluation Committee

The panel submitted its findings to a separate evaluation committee consisting of Dean of Engineering Anantha Chandrakasan, Mechanical Engineering Department Head Evelyn Wang, Physics Department Head Peter Fisher, Mechanical Engineering Associate Department Head Pierre Lermusiaux, and Faculty Chair Rick Danheiser. The evaluation committee convened several times, including meetings with the review panel members and with Professor Lloyd. Based on the panel’s conclusions, the evaluation committee recommended a set of disciplinary actions, which they stated ""focused on Professor Lloyd’s poor judgment and the impact of his actions on the community, which he may not have yet fully appreciated.""

My Decision

After conferring with senior administrative and faculty leaders, as well as the two committees, I have decided to implement the recommended disciplinary actions. 

For a period of five years, a set of disciplinary actions will limit Professor Lloyd’s compensation, his ability to engage in solicitation of donors and foundations, and his involvement in first-year undergraduate advising, and will impose several other restrictions on normal privileges accorded to a faculty member. In addition, Professor Lloyd will be expected to undergo training on professional conduct before resuming certain activities on campus, including teaching. 

These steps cannot undo the harm done. Professor Lloyd’s failure to share what he knew about Epstein’s conviction when he accepted his 2012 donations was unacceptable. His interactions with Epstein and certain of his actions surrounding acceptance of the donations serve to highlight the importance of the current Institute-wide effort to develop clearer guidelines for engaging with donors. 

I recognize that many in our community remain deeply disturbed by the interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and that some will be disappointed by this decision. In addition, for some, this outcome may renew past pain. If you feel you would benefit from support or guidance at this time, you can find a range of resources here.

I would like to close by extending my gratitude to the entire MIT community for your engagement, your candor, and your care for MIT.

In some departments, all classes and advising will be online, but this does not matter.  Because this requirement did not exist in the Fall, there are students in other countries with long-term leases, children in schools, spouses with jobs, no visa, US bank account or arrangement for local housing, whose plans are suddenly upended. The text makes clear that this policy change is for bureaucratic convenience of MIT and not a mandate from the government.  Within MIT, the decision was apparently made without consulting the departments. You can imagine how many students are freaking out. 

The new policy is [https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/) but since that site is restricted to MIT users only, I copied relevant text below.

**Graduate Students**  
RA, TAs, and Fellows: ***Graduate students with RA, TA, or fellowship appointments in Spring 2021 are being asked to return/come to the U.S. by January 30, 2021, in order to maintain their appointments***. A graduate student may be eligible to conduct their RA,TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad only if:

* Visa delays, travel restrictions, border closures, and other COVID-related factors prevent their travel to the U.S.; 
* The student or a member of the student’s household has been instructed by a medical provider not to travel to the U.S. for medical reasons; or
* The student is caring for a family member with COVID-19 or other illness.

If a graduate student with an RA, TA, or fellowship appointment is unable to return to/enter the U.S. for the above reasons, and they meet the other criteria listed below (see FAQ), the student should contact their graduate administrator who will submit an [intake form](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6txpJ8RUbGpbY9v) for the student’s remote international appointment.

**These requests will be reviewed individually to determine what options, if any, may be available to the student. Therefore, any student who believes they will need to purse their RA, TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad in Spring 2021 should immediately begin working with their department/program.**

Hourly Paid Appointments: Graduate students are not permitted to have hourly-paid appointments from outside the U.S. during Spring 2021 term. Intake forms should not be submitted for these students.  


**Why is MIT changing its guidelines for remote student appointments conducted from outside the U.S.?**  
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, MIT has supported hundreds of students pursuing their appointments remotely from abroad. As we explained in our [previous guidance and FAQs](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/), these remote international appointments pose a number of logistical, compliance, and financial challenges for both MIT and those working remotely abroad. To address these challenges, MIT set up a new process in May to review and facilitate these appointments on a temporary basis. The process was updated in August to include specific guidance for the Fall 2020 term.

MIT has reviewed and approved over 800 requests for students to pursue their appointments from outside the U.S. Many of these requests were for students who remained in the U.S at the start of the pandemic, but who wished to return home to pursue their studies and appointments in their home communities.

We are pleased that so many students were able to pursue their appointments this summer and fall from the locations that worked best for them. Unfortunately, given the increasing challenges posed by these international appointments—including the duration of many of these appointments, the fluid situation relating to the pandemic, and the relevant external guidance—we need to modify our approach beginning with the Spring 2021 term.",New residency requirement sprung on graduate students,t3_kalf1i,41.0,0.89

Question: For other classes in prior semesters (e.g. 8.02) there have been methods to anonymously express concerns about a class through the piazza forum. I (and I believe other students also (cf. below)) wish to anonymously express my concerns about 7.06, or to express my concerns in a safe setting. Are there ways in which to do this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Rant: In my opinion, the tests (93% of the grade) in 7.06 are horribly made. For those not in the class this semester, the questions are extremely vague but graded via a hyper-specific rubric while simultaneously docking for any extraneous information (in whatever way they define that based on the rubric, because again, the questions are very vague). For each of the 7.06 exams so far, I think they were content wise easy, and feel like I did well on them. However, each time, I was hit with an extra minus 10-15% for obscure/(extremely) nitpicky reasons. 

I believe students have complained in class about this before, as there was an email from the instructors with a proposed ""solution"" to this problem: to ask clarification questions about vaguely phrased problems DURING the exam via a google forum. In addition to the fact that the onus should not be on the students to design questions well (and that it can take up time that is supposed to be used on solving the exam), this is also unhelpful, as sometimes questions ask about something specific but have supposed rubric ""answers"" containing what I would consider entirely extraneous information. Basically, we don't know what questions to ask about the badly phrased problems because while taking the test they seem normal, only when comparing them with the rubric do they become respectively vague, unintuitive, or unclear.\* \*with respect to what the rubric was looking for 

I have for a little bit now stopped studying the biology for this class as much/attending class and instead focused on trying to figure out what the instructors want from me on tests (this is something I used to do in high school, and I hate that I have to do it now) -- this has actually helped my grade go up, not down. Singlehandedly this class has made me want to change majors as, although I love biology, I don't feel like focusing more on ""test-taking"" than learning in the future.

Dear Faculty Colleagues,

We write to let you know about a decision regarding collaborations  with Aramco, a founding member of the MIT Energy Initiative. After  thorough review and consultations within MIT and Aramco, Aramco’s  membership in MITEI will not be renewed, and new sponsored engagements  between MIT and Aramco will not be considered at this time.

Within MIT, this outcome was informed by extensive consultations and  community input over the past year and a half, and by specific  recommendations from the [International Advisory Committee (IAC)](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/international-advisory-committee), input from the [Ad Hoc Faculty Committee on Guidelines for Outside Engagements](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/ad-hoc-faculty-committee-guidelines-outside-engagements#:~:text=The%20Ad%20Hoc%20Committee%20on%20Guidelines%20for%20Outside%20Engagements%20will,MIT%20community%20during%20Spring%202020.&amp;text=Several%20members%20of%20the%20ad,ensure%20coordination%20in%20their%20work), and review by the Senior Risk Group. A full description of this process appeared in the May issue of the [Faculty Newsletter](https://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/325/lester.html).

Aramco has been a valued research partner for MIT. It is a technical  leader in many areas of engineering and science, and it has provided  many valuable research opportunities for MIT faculty and students which  have contributed to advances in fundamental energy science and  technology. Our researchers have also forged productive individual  working relationships with their Aramco colleagues.

We appreciate the thoughtful consideration that has been given to  this matter by faculty committees and groups and by individual members  of the community.

Sincerely,

Cornell University initially failed to report to U.S. authorities more than $1.2 billion in foreign funds it has received in recent years, including $760 million related to its campus in Qatar and about $1 million in contracts from Chinese telecom company Huawei Technologies Co., the U.S. Education Department indicated in its latest report on schools and foreign contracts.

The names of Cornell and other universities are redacted in a report the department released Tuesday, but are identifiable based on other details provided in the report and related correspondence by the department with the schools.

The 34-page report provides an update to a broad investigation the Education Department undertook last year into whether U.S. universities are appropriately reporting all foreign contracts and gifts that total more than $250,000 in one year. It isn’t illegal to take such funds, but universities are obligated to disclose them under a statute that is decades old but hasn’t been vigorously enforced in past years.

The department said Tuesday it planned to condition access to participation in federal student-loan programs on compliance with foreign-funding obligations.

The government has expressed concern that foreign money may come with strings attached, provide foreign governments improper access to sensitive research or limit academic freedom in some programs.

“U.S. institutions are technological treasure troves where leading and internationally competitive fields, such as nanoscience, are booming. For too long, these institutions have provided an unprecedented level of access to foreign governments and their instrumentalities in an environment lacking transparency and oversight by the industry, the Department, and our partner agencies,” the Education Department said in its report.

More on U.S. Reviews of Foreign Funding

Education Department Investigating Harvard, Yale Over Foreign Funding (Feb. 13)
The Justice Department has been cracking down on violations of a law that requires lobbyists for foreign nationals and governments to publicly disclose that work. A top Republican fundraiser pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a related charge.

Education Department investigators found that “many large and well-resourced institutions of higher education have aggressively pursued and accepted foreign money,” while failing to comply with reporting obligations, according to the new report.

“Evidence suggests institutional decision-making is generally divorced from any sense of obligation to our taxpayers or concern for our American national interests, security, or values,” the report added.

The report said a school, identifiable as Georgetown University, has worked with the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, “derived $2,360,807” from an arrangement that demonstrated “significant intermingling” with China, and supported an academic exchange with Communist officials through the central committee’s Party School.

A Georgetown spokeswoman said the school’s tax filings show a nearly identical dollar amount in expenditures in the region, but not gifts or contracts from foreign entities, and that the details in the report were “a bit puzzling to us.”

U.S. universities have generally defended their international collaborations and said the agency’s reporting requirements were unclear.

A Cornell spokesman acknowledged the university’s past errors in reporting and said it had undertaken significant efforts since July 2019 to file accurate disclosures of the foreign funds.

Since 2019, the Education Department has opened investigations into a dozen top universities including Harvard University and Yale University, finding that U.S. universities failed to report at least $6.5 billion in such funds.

The new report details information the agency received from Georgetown, Texas A&amp;M University, Cornell, Rutgers University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland. The other schools under investigation are continuing to provide information or have yet to provide documents, the report said.

One school, identifiable as Cornell, admitted that it failed to document its institution in Qatar in previous reports to the department, and said it was dumbfounded about how to explain the error, the report said. The university has a branch of its medical school in the Gulf country.

Multiple schools also belatedly reported receiving millions of dollars from Huawei, the report said, referring to the tech giant whose equipment U.S. national security officials have warned could be used for espionage, which the company denies.

American universities largely stopped taking Huawei funds by 2018 based on the U.S. concerns, but many top schools had previously entered into extensive contracts with the company, the report said. The university identifiable as MIT, for example, held around $11 million in contracts and agreements with Huawei since 2013, ranging from research agreements to donations for specific projects and programs, the report said.",MIT and others being investigated for not reporting foreign ties.,t3_jfc4j4,34.0,0.85

I study pretty efficiently (I'm sure I can improve upon this but it has worked for the most part in the past) but I still get C/D/Fs on my tests. Recently one of my profs showed a test distribution and I  scored in the bottom 1%.

It probably doesn't help that I grew up in the typical Chinese-American family, applied here for my parents, and admitted for my parents. I really wanted to study classics at Berkeley for law school (I live in NorCal), but even aside from my parents, people told me I was stupid to turn down MIT for a public state school. Every time I try to talk to my associate advisor it ends up in me bluffing and saying how excited I am for the potential that this school offers, but in reality, I can't find any reason to go on. I feel like I basically ruined my future.

Has anyone else dealt with this? I know that online school probably changes the experience by a great margin, but I'm not sure if this will change regardless of campus. A lot of people tell me that ""you're not the only one"" and ""there are people doing worse than you,"" and I try to take this to heart, but it means very little when I'm actually doing worse than 99% of students in my class.

0.0,1602768041.0,3.0,mit,"Hi everyone,

So I’m a current freshman here at MIT and just wanted to ask a question. With me wanting to double major in Aerospace Engineering and Physics to try to get both a systems Engineering and technical science background in my undergrad (but also because I love all of it) and after seeing how other students do it successfully without dying, its something I’m pretty set on committing to here at MIT. 

However, I started looking into the Material Science Department here and after poking my head into some of the research labs (MIT Nano) and letting my love for chemistry come out, I’m now considering maybe minoring in Mat Sci along with my double major (because I love Aero/Astro and Physics a lot more).

The way I’m looking at it would be if it gets too stressful and it’s not fun anymore I’d drop it, but what do you guys think about actually trying to do that? I thought it would be awesome to not only get Engineering education, but also a good knowledge base in chemistry and physics as well! 

Would this be a great thing to enter industry with or do you guys think it wouldn’t be worth it? 

*Note: I am trying to have a social life and I don’t want to do this just to flex. I just saw it as a great way to combine all my interests into a great undergrad experience. Since my concentrations in Aero/Astro and Physics would be robotics and propulsion, a Mat Sci minor made sense :)

As part of its pandemic policies, MIT issued a Return to Work on Campus policy, detailing the safety requirements for being on campus, such as completing the daily health attestation and the wearing of face coverings.

To aid in making quick and consistent responses to alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy, MIT will follow a new process, summarized below. This new process (Touchstone login required) applies to allegations against faculty and staff; a similar expedited Committee on Discipline process is in place for allegations against students.

The key provisions are:

Expedited review process

All complaints of alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy are forwarded to the Manager of Institutional Compliance at covidcompliance@mit.edu.
The Manager of Institutional Compliance, in consultation with the OGC and others, will work with the DLC to find facts and appropriately respond.
The alleged violator will be informed and given an opportunity to respond.
Decision making

Low-level violations: DLC will determine appropriate response and/or sanction.
Other violations:
By faculty, other academic, postdoctoral, or research staff: Provost or VP for Research, in consultation with the school dean, will determine response/sanctioning.
By other staff: VP for HR will determine response/sanctioning.
Guidelines for Response/Sanctions

The decision maker – the DLC, Provost, VP for Research, or VP for Human Resources – will refer to the following guidelines when determining the response/sanctions. That said, each case is unique, and these guidelines are not prescriptive; they are intended to offer a basis from which to make a decision about a case. The decision-maker should consider the totality of the circumstances, including aggravating and mitigating factors, when determining sanctions.

 

Type of Violation

Potential Outcome

First-time face covering

Written reminder of policy, and warning that additional violation of this requirement could result in discipline.

 

First time “low level”

Disciplinary written warning.

Second time “low level”

OR

First time “medium level”

One-day disciplinary suspension without pay or access.

Repetition of above categories and
“high level” violations
Five-day disciplinary suspension without pay, or termination of employment. If individual is a tenured faculty member, referral to Provost for appropriate sanction.

 

KEY:

Types of “low-level” violations: one-time face covering or social distancing violation.
Types of “medium-level” violations: one-time access to building without approved access, failure to test, or second incident of a failure to wear a face covering.
Types of “high-level” violations: violating quarantine, repeated violations of the above categories.

From: Suzy M. Nelson, Vice President and Dean for Student Life  
Sent: Monday, September 7, 2020 12:00  
Subject: A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies
 
YOU NEED TO KNOW: off-campus event prohibition; expedited disciplinary process for Covid policy violations; success depends on all of us!

Dear graduate students living off campus,

This is an unusual fall semester as MIT manages a pandemic, and the United States and countries around the world deal with the mounting toll of Covid cases.  Against this backdrop, there is continued unrest in cities across the country in the wake of police violence, systemic inequity, and the deaths of too many Black Americans. Further exacerbating these situations are natural disasters in the country's southern and western regions and a contentious national election.

To all of you anxious about any of these issues, know that MIT is here for you. Please reach out if you need to talk with someone.

MIT's plan for moving forward during the pandemic is guided by science and common sense. As I detail in a message I sent to graduate students living on campus, life at MIT is different now. But, if we work together and adhere to and have patience with Covid policies--both from MIT and in the communities where you live and work now--we can meet the challenges ahead.

Events, parties, and gatherings off campus. Don't organize or attend off-campus events, parties, or gatherings until further notice--they are a leading cause of Covid hotspots on college campuses. MIT will take swift disciplinary action in response to violations of MIT Covid policies through an expedited Committee on Discipline process. Students who attend or host off-campus parties, events, or gatherings may face disciplinary action including potential suspension or loss of future campus access.

Campus Access. Students living off-campus who have not been granted official access to MIT facilities through Covid Pass for academic and research purposes may not be on campus or in campus buildings at any time. Students who do have official access through Covid Pass may use academic and research facilities they are cleared to enter, DAPER indoor and outdoor facilities (with a valid membership), and designated outdoor common areas in groups no larger than the posted occupancy. Only current MIT Housing residents may enter the Student Center and use its foodservice facilities. This chart may help clarify who has access to campus facilities. 

Additional Policies and Updates

As you can see, we take student health, wellness, and safety seriously. Please review The Mind and Hand Book, which contains essential information on standards of behavior and student life policies. Other important policies include:

  - MIT's community standards such as the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act statement;
  - Discrimination, harassment, and Title IX resources that help make our campus safe; and
  - MIT's policy against hazing to support a safe and welcoming environment for all.

The success of the semester depends on every one of us! 

The Institute's decision to stick with our reopening plan is grounded in our confidence that every MIT community member will rise to the challenge.

Our plan for the fall and beyond is being put to the test. Working together, we can pass it with flying colors.

Best,  
Suzy",A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies,t3_ip3hri,9.0,0.92

I'm an incoming freshman, and I want to double major in math and physics. I successfully got credit for 18.01 and 18.02 and plan on trying to take the 18.03 ASE, but I'm mostly concerned about physics. In hindsight, I know I made some mistakes on the 8.01 ASE (silly things like forgetting a minus sign, but I'm not sure if I will be heavily docked for this), and, while I did self-study a lot of E&amp;M and Quantum Mechanics, I figured I should probably take the courses since I likely didn't have the same rigor as the MIT courses, especially since my only high school physics course was non-AP (my school didnt offer it) and wasn't particularly rigorous.

So, my question is this: is it still feasible for me to pursue a double major even if I have to start from 8.01? Would I be able to finish in 4 years?

There is also a separate line of EE classes (EECS16AB) on lin-alg and diffeqs with a focus on circuit analysis. I've noticed that problem sets from my classes ripped off some problems from older MIT handouts on OCW, so I'm suspecting that both schools if not many follow a similar pattern.

Pros of not taking ASEs:

* Easier classes (I could frontload on my major classes and retake my GIRs sophomore/junior year when I'm taking tougher classes)
* Better GPA (I basically know &gt;70% of the material for 8.01, 18.01, 6.0001, and 7.03)

Ito promptly resigned.

The Media Lab has always occupied a curious place in the tech world. According to itself, it “transcends known boundaries and disciplines by actively promoting a unique, antidisciplinary culture that emboldens unconventional mixing and matching of seemingly disparate research areas … In its earliest years, some saw the Media Lab as a house of misfits. Here, the emphasis was on building; the Lab’s motto was “demo or die.””

It ceased being viewed as a house of misfits a long time ago. Instead it has become perceived as a hyper-prestigious, creme-de-la-creme entity, a weird mixture of counterculture and patrician, seen as home to the best (and coolest) of the best, whose annual budget has tripled from $25 million in 2009 to $75 million in 2019. It seems fair to estimate that roughly a billion inflation-adjusted dollars have been spent on it since its birth in 1986.

While it’s an academic institution it has always been exceptionally business-oriented. “At first glance, much of the Media Lab’s research may seem tangential to current business realities, but for more than 30 years, the Lab has demonstrated that seemingly “far out” research can find its way into the most conventional—and useful—applications … The Media Lab has spawned dozens of new products by our members, and over 150 start-up companies,” to quote, again, them.

And yet. One can’t help but notice. Consider its basic ingredients:

+    founded in 1986, as Moore’s Law began to hit us all, and tech began the exponential growth that has made it the world’s dominant force
+    at the most prestigious technical university on the entire planet
+    in a position to pick and choose from the brightest minds of its generation
+    allotted $1 billion to spend over those thirty years of hockey-stick growth

Given all that, wouldn’t you have expected … well … a whole lot more than what it has actually accomplished?

=== ==== =====

Given all that, wouldn’t you have expected … well … a whole lot more than what it has actually accomplished?

Because that list of accomplishments is surprisingly scrawny. Take its spin-off companies. Here’s its list. Trivia question: how many Media Lab spinoffs have gone public, without merging or being acquired, in its 33 years of existence? As far as I can tell, the answer is one, and even that comes with a sizable asterisk: the Art Technology Group, which didn’t start building products until six years after it spun out (it was a consultancy), IPOd during the first dot-boom, and was eventually acquired by Oracle.

There are companies you’ll recognize on that list. Well, there’s one: BuzzFeed. Yes, really. There are a few others of note. Harmonix, makers of Rock Band. Makani Power, acquired by Alphabet six years ago. Elance, which became Upwork and then had its platform phased out. Jana. Formlabs, Otherlab, The Echo Nest, all of which I think are great, but none of which I would have heard of if not for some personal connections. One Laptop Per Child, a bad idea a decade ago and a forgotten one now. And, notably, E Ink, the Media Lab’s one definite, unambiguous big win … back in 1996.

It’s not nothing, but it’s so much less than you’d expect, given its ingredients. It’s certainly no Bell Labs, or Xerox PARC, or even Y Combinator, and I say that as someone who is less of a YC enthusiast than most of the Valley.

OK, I hear you arguing, but they’re a basic research facility! Spinoff companies are not their true measure of success! Sure. Fine. So let’s take a hard look at their own list of their top 30 tech products or platforms (PDF). Aside from E Ink — which, again, was 23 years ago — doesn’t that look a lot like a list of occasionally interesting, but fundamentally limited and/or niche, technologies? Doesn’t it seem rather utterly devoid of any significant impact on the world?

Wouldn’t you have expected so, so much more?

Criticisms that the Lab is more about style and sizzle than serious substance are not exactly new. Nor are they old: here’s a piece condemning its recent “personal food computer” as smoke and mirrors that doesn’t actually work. This “Hunter S. Negroponte” piece dates back to the 1990s. It’s satire, but if you read it, you’ll likely find you can’t help but raise your eyebrows and wonder just how far back the Media Lab’s systemic problems go.

Maybe if it hadn’t been a “plutocratic friendocracy,” to quote former Media Lab faculty, and it had actually systemically favored the best and brightest and most innovative, regardless of background or personal connection — maybe then things would have been very different. Maybe it would actually have been what it pretended to be for all this time.",E15,t3_hso1py,0.0,0.49

I've heard different things from different people, from fully remote to remote for a few months... For grad students / other members of the MIT community, to what extent are your labs remote?  Has anything been announced of the extent to which it would be possible to be remote in the spring?

I'm going to be doing an MEng (in a research area which requires no physical lab components) after a gap year starting in the fall and am trying to figure out housing.  I currently do not live in Cambridge, but my lease is ending, and I need to know whether or not to renew it or start looking for a place in Cambridge. 

Normally I would just live in Cambridge, but given that Cambridge is relatively expensive, much of the MIT community will not be there, and access to MIT facilities will be limited, I don't really see the point if things are remote.  Obviously I am willing to move to Cambridge, but would prefer if possible not to commit to a 1 year lease in Cambridge only to find that everything is remote.  Similarly, I would hate to commit to another 1 year lease remote only to find out that research or classes will be on campus.  I'd prefer not to have to move to Cambridge midway through the semester but have heard that things may go back on campus around then.  It also seems to be difficult to find places that are willing to rent for less than a full year.

Is anybody else in a similar situation?  If so, what are you doing? Do you know to what extent it will be possible / acceptable to do the MEng remotely??

International students are too big of a cash cow for universities to let go.

=======

Regardless of whether the deportation order is legal it is indisputably an incredibly dumb policy move. These are exactly the people there is near universal agreement we want to attract to and incentivize to stay in the country. They are the least likely to become wards of the state and most likely to fill needed gaps in the highly skilled sectors of the job market.


======

This is so frustrating to see. As a student I’ve switched from online to seated over the semesters. So these students would be deported for a semester then next semester when they take one seated they’d be allowed to come back, but then the following semester if they take all online they’d be deported again? Sounds like a huge waste of time and people’s money traveling that much. Especially since we are in new territory and who knows how long universities will be doing mostly online, this may go on for a couple semesters.


=====

Are international students who take online only courses normally granted F1 visas?  No, but international students who take courses at Harvard and MIT are, and Harvard and MIT don't normally go 100% online.

And as the complaint lays out, ICE actually provided exceptions to that policy for the second half of the spring 2020 semester, by explaining that its typical rules should not apply throughout the ""duration of the emergency.""

 [Williams College](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/780717Z:US), the richest liberal arts school in the U.S., is reducing its cost by 15% for families on a one-time basis for the coming academic year and canceling sports competition and travel for the season as the coronavirus upends higher education.

The changes come “in recognition of the extraordinary circumstances and of this academic year and the uncertainty we face in the year ahead,” the Williamstown, Massachusetts, school said in a [statement](https://president.williams.edu/writings-and-remarks/letters-from-the-president/announcing-our-plan-for-fall-2020/) Monday. 

“This reduction recognizes the fact that the pandemic and associated challenges are requiring us to cancel winter study as well as fall athletics competition and many student activities, among other opportunities that we usually encourage families to expect as part of their student’s education,” school President Maud Mandel said.

Schools across the U.S. are coping with uncertainty for the year that begins in August or September as it’s largely unclear whether in-person courses will be offered given the rise in Covid-19 cases. Students at dozens of schools have already balked at the full price for last semester’s tuition with months of online classes, suing for billions of dollars in refunds.

“In higher education, we’re trained to believe that expensive is good,” said [Robert Kelchen](https://www.shu.edu/profiles/robertkelchen.cfm), an associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University. “Now, in this economic crisis, families are more price-sensitive than they have been.”

The move by Williams, which has about 2,100 students, may put pressure on other selective liberal arts schools to follow.

“For this year, it may be less expensive for the colleges to do because a lot of students who pay full price are international students, and they may not be counting on them,” Kelchen said.",Williams College decreases tuition by 15% for 2020-21 academic year,t3_hiehfp,39.0,0.86

After doing some research about the consequences to the other players in this story, it came to my attention the role played by MIT. In particular the support to Jeffrey Epstein and the lack of regrets shown by the institution and its members.

It came ta my attention, in particular, the role of MIT Media Lab and Joi Ito, who was fired. But my surprise was the story of  Neri Oxman, whose work has been produced with money from a network of pedophilia, and she still teaching in MIT and representing the values of the institution!

For those who don't know the story, Jeffrey Epstein supported her work through donations, AFTER he was charged the first time for child trafficking, and he was a known child abuser. Apparently, his strategy was to donate to many people with good reputation but lacking ethical principles, to present himself as a philanthropist to the judge. When the money started flowing to the lab, one of his students told her that he felt uncomfortable using such money. She lied, telling him that she had ensured that no money from Epstein was being used. So, the students, who demonstrated more ethical values than her, continued working. Later it was discovered that she accepted the money with the condition that nobody knew, but not only she knew but also lied to her students to use them, and MIT resources, to produce presents for a pedophile, so money keeps flowing.

So, if you went to MIT, there are some chances you made presents for convicted (but wealthy) pedophiles.

MIT did nothing, tried to hide everything under the carpet, and had her superstar professor as an example of women in STEM. Remember, if you are a woman in STEM, MIT thinks the model you should follow is that everything is allowed, even if everything means supporting sexual abuse of girls.

I'm still confused about how MIT as an institution or its students and faculty bodies have decided to look away instead of on deeply clean your institution. But MIT is not the only one, surprisingly Netflix, who just made a 4 hours documentary to denounce Jeffery Epstein's case, did it a few months after releasing a chapter of Abstract highlighting the work of your beloved MIT professor. A work produced with money from a known pedophile by someone who knew the origin of the money! Cynicism over 9000!

The tolerance to child abuse by MIT is disgusting and disappointing. So, next time that you walk in the Media Lab and see the last artistic installation of one of your professors at the Media Lab lobby think about this: that has been built with money from child abuse.

### My experience with the FEE: Utter Failure.

I've spoken English my whole life. In the summer of 2008, I had to do the Freshman Essay Evaluation.

The topics were enjoyable to read and think about: The security of electronic voting machines and the ethics of paying human research subjects.

I could not do the writing. No words onto paper. No words onto keyboard. I..... just. could. not. write.
This had happened to me before. I sat for hours in my room, trying to get words to come out. None.
Usually, after enough time digging my nails into my skin, mentally shouting at myself to just buckle down and get it done, and eventually some tears.... something would unblock and I'd be able to write a first draft. Never any time to edit it, but oh well.

That summer, after 9 days of misery, I turned in nothing.

I figured that I'd learn to overcome this by taking the technical writing class at MIT. Fun fact: no. The professor who teaches that class is _not_ a psychotherapist. Neither are the staff of the MIT writing center.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Correct, non-actionable advice: Just get words onto paper.

Good writing comes from editing -- molding clay into solid bricks and stacking them on top of each other. You need to have some words and paragraphs to mould and push into a good structure.

People will often phrase this as ""Don't care what someone would think; Just write a [crappy first draft](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf) to get your thoughts on paper"". Fun fact: no. If you only imagine yourself doing a crappy job, you will not be very motivated to do it.

So how do you get some clay? How do you lead your brain to make the words? 

------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to actually execute that: Have a conversation.

Brains do things that they find rewarding.

If you have writers' block, you might notice that you're perfectly fine talking with a human about the topic. That is because you can see the social reward in real time. You're turning vague notions into organized thoughts for the benefit of another person and (if they are paying attention to you), you can see their understanding. You might be fine texting someone or getting on reddit and commenting on a thread. Same thing: You imagine them listening to what you say and reacting.

Notice that commenting on reddit is a form of writing. Notice you're not writing crap, You're having a conversation. Even if you're shitposting, you're just having a boisterous conversation.

If you do this over IM with someone who is interested in the topic or prompt, you can then copy-paste your words and have the clay to mold into an essay.

If you do this over audio and record it (especially with an auto-transcription app like [otter](https://otter.ai/), you can kinda do the same.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### What to do if you can't talk to someone -- Reward Loops 

I am a software engineer and we have technique for writing code even when we're worried that it will be crap or we don't know how it should be structured.

#### Test Driven Development

The technique is to repeat some small simple steps:

1. Write a program that does literally nothing.

2. Write a tiny program to check if the first program does a tiny bit.

3. The second program is a ""test"". Run it so you know that it says ""nope"".

4. Change the first program to do a tiny bit.

5. Run the test to see that it says ""yep"". Feel successful. 😃

6. Write a third tiny program to check if the first program does a tiny bit more.

7. Run this new test to see that it says ""nope.""

8. Add a tiny bit more to your first program...

Continue like this, writing tests and first running them so you know that they actually say ""nope"" when a feature is missing or buggy. You end up with the program you want and a bunch of tiny programs that automatically check that it works.

Notice that this technique keeps putting a small step of a goal right in front of you, letting you try things and observe the results, and showing you when you succeed at it.

[This is the same thing that video games do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGL5YGcAxEI&amp;t=22).

#### How to start a core reward loop for writing.

In order to feel rewarded for making progress, you need to imagine that you're succeeding at something. 

Succeeding at what? An essay asks you to answer a question. 

So type your own question and respond to it. Type the first response that comes to mind, even if that is another question. Just keep responding, writing questions guided by your curiosity or confusion and answers as you see them. 

Set a 10-minute [timer](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/) before you start this. 

At the end of the 10 minutes, notice if any questions seem relevant to the assignment. Copy those to a new page and start again. If your questions are along the lines of ""Why am I such a lazy piece of shit?"", then save that file somewhere else, open a new page, then get up and go for a walk or do some exercise. Come back to this with a fresh mindset.

Just keep typing questions and answers. You'll likely notice yourself wanting to give longer explanations to the questions and wanting to re-frame the questions. Once you've started doing that, you're plugged-in: you've begun to imagine a conversation partner and what they need to hear to satisfy their curiosity. You've got your reward model and it has started giving you incremental signs-of-success.

[There is a reason why Plato wrote the Dialogues as...a dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_dialogue#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20Socratic%20dialogues,which%20Socrates%20is%20a%20character.)

[There is a reason why the first great works of literature come from oral tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry)

Writing is a technology we humans had to build _on top of conversation_.

So keep the conversation going and you'll soon have enough hefty concepts for a first draft. Feel free to lengthen that timer from 10 minutes to 20 or 30 in the style of the [pomodoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0k0TQfZGSc). After several paragraphs, you might find yourself getting a bit confused and wanting to re-structure your sections so they make more sense to you. That is fine to do. You might want to make side-notes on a piece of physical paper or draw a diagram. Thats cool too. Just keep moving and keep a regular rhythm of checking in on yourself to see if you're still having a conversation that might be relevant. You are making clay. It is fine that some of it won't be used.

### A note about the question ""Why"".

Yes, this does mean that you might start out asking ""why does anybody care?"" about the assignment. You might have previously asked a teacher and heard ""Just write the essay."" Your parent might have told you ""Because I said so"". You might have learned to stifle asking ""Why?"" in certain situations. 

You are now an adult. 

Your whole life is optional.^([1])

You have the freedom to pursue an answer to ""Why"". No particular person is obligated to answer you, but you can go ask someone else.

You can also just decide not to do something if you don't find a compelling reason for doing it.

On the other hand, 14.01 was very mathematical, and I presume much of the other classes in economics are similarly so. I could see a lot of value in having a HASS double major that trains me in a different way of thinking, in oral/written communication, and in reflecting more deeply about the implications of the products and services that I create.

**What We Know Now**

*During these uncertain times, some things are already clear and should be factored into the design and implementation of any option for the future. Below, we list some of them:* 

* MIT must meet all federal, state, and city requirements and adhere to public health orders. We will benchmark our planning and practices against the current guidance from other credible and relevant sources.
   * [Massachusetts COVID-19 Reopening Guidance](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/reopening-massachusetts)
   * [Public Health Principles for a Phased Reopening During COVID-19: “Guidance for Governors”; April 17, 2020](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200417-reopening-guidance-governors.pdf)
   * [American College Health Associationʼs Guidelines: Considerations for Reopening Institutions of Higher Education in the COVID-19 Era Guidance](https://www.acha.org/documents/resources/guidelines/ACHA_Considerations_for_Reopening_IHEs_in_the_COVID-19_Era_May2020.pdf) 
* The implementation of testing, tracing, and treatment protocols is essential to mitigating the risk of community spread of COVID-19.
* There will be ongoing physical distancing in classroom, research lab, residential, and work spaces. 
   * Roughly 100 fall subjects rely on access to the physical campus space to achieve the subject learning objectives. Roughly 3,000 students enroll in these subjects in a typical year. Physical distancing constraints in our instructional spaces will limit the in-person teaching that can be done on campus, and require that we teach and learn in different ways (e.g., fewer students at a time in teaching labs, design studios, project, and performance spaces and potential for broader use of the day for class hours).
   * Much of the curriculum (lectures, recitations, seminars) will be offered remotely in the fall and perhaps the spring as well, even when some or many students may reside on campus.
   * In the undergraduate residence halls, use of common spaces will be limited, food service options will include take-out services, and cook-for-yourself programming will likely be suspended during this period. P-setting and interactions with peers, house team members, and GRAs will be highly constrained under physical distancing. Recreational programming will be online or offered in de-densified settings. Access to common amenities such as gyms, lounges, and study rooms will be limited.
   * On-campus office spaces in which staff interact with faculty, students, and other staff (e.g., DSL headquarters, DAPER check-in, OVC headquarters, SFS, S\^3, OGE, MIT Medical, etc.) will need to be revamped to facilitate physical distancing. Examples include removing some furniture and chairs, putting up Plexiglass barriers and tape in lobby areas, and removing vending machines and reusable kitchen items. 
* Ongoing restricted access to MIT buildings will be necessary.
   * The campus will be allocated into sectors that will be entered by MIT ID-card based access. This will be less convenient and will require more planning to oneʼs day when coming to campus buildings to use on-campus resources. MIT is testing and adapting such approaches now with the existing on-campus population of residents, approved researchers, and campus support staff. 
* Not everyone will be able to or will choose to return to campus, even if permitted to do so. 
   * Some people fall into a high health risk category for COVID-19 or live with people who are high risk. Every member of the MIT community must do their part to protect these members of our community. Others may be impeded from being on campus due to travel restrictions and visa delays. Still other community members may have unique living situations where teaching, learning, and/or working are made more difficult by technology barriers, family responsibilities, and financial challenges. We must be agile and able to make arrangements for individuals who are remote.
   * The limited availability of MIT-owned residential beds in a de-densified campus setting poses a significant constraint. The Division of Student Life estimates the availability of 1,900 beds at one student per room and a 3:1 student/water closet ratio. Securing hotel beds may increase our capacity figures but doing so adds significant costs and presents potential negative implications for the student experience. 
* We will maintain our commitment to high-quality education, student support, and co-curricular and experiential learning opportunities in every option. We will revise academic policies and regulations to respond to the plan that is ultimately put in place.
   * Consistent with MITʼs mission, we will deliver “an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery”. We will ensure that students progress towards their degrees, minimize subject cancellations, and minimize pre-requisite disruptions. We have developed optimization methods to rapidly re-plan class schedules to achieve our objectives. 
* We will maintain our commitment to excellence in research and [graduate education](https://covid19.mit.edu/safe-gradual-return-to-campus-for-graduate-students). [The research ramp up process is designed to ensure this objective.](https://covid19.mit.edu/initial-process-for-on-campus-research-ramp-up)
* Creating a dedicated isolation space for students and other campus residents who test positive for COVID-19 is necessary in any of the scenarios being considered, as is a plan to scale back the reopening if community health and safety concerns necessitate a reduction in campus density levels again.

**What We Donʼt Know Yet**

*There are certain things we cannot know or guarantee at this moment, and there are certain questions we havenʼt answered yet. Any option for the fall and beyond will have several uncertainties in common, including:*

* The trajectory of the pandemic and the timeline for the development of a cost-effective, widely available vaccine and/or therapeutics.
   * We donʼt know what the public health situation will be within the city or state in the fall, including when or if a second wave will occur, when a vaccine or therapeutics will be available or once available, if we will be able to procure large enough quantities to immunize the entire community. Nevertheless, we must be prepared for dramatically changing health conditions in the next academic year (positive or negative). 
   * Based on what we know now, antibody testing is not likely to be helpful in the short to medium term for planning for return to campus but [may be helpful eventually](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19).   
* Community membersʼ willingness to comply with physical distancing rules in classroom, research lab, residential, and work spaces. 
   * We donʼt know how well students and the rest of the MIT community will follow physical distancing policies; some current residents would like [stricter rules, and others would like more relaxed rules](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6oqkxb6gipquxj/strengthen%20or%20relax%20housing%20policies.pdf?dl=0). 
* Who will be allowed to travel to campus, and the best decisions for which undergraduate students will return and when for options where only a fraction of the undergraduates are on campus at a given time.
   * For any case where only a fraction of the undergraduates are invited back to campus over a given period, we will have to make difficult choices about who to bring to campus and when, but we will seek to equally support and serve all of our students. We will also optimize our subject schedules to increase the ability of students to take the classes they need to progress academically. 
* Space availability to enable physical distancing on campus (in our academic spaces and undergraduate residence halls).
   * At current physical distancing guidelines, and taking into account the varied types of learning spaces and learning activities in MIT classes, we estimate that the academic campus can accommodate approximately 4,000 learners at a time. We could think of this as 4,000 students in classrooms/labs/studios/seminar rooms per day; or 8,000 if each student had a half-day on campus. Scheduling and judicious use of the hands-on-campus resource for in-person educational opportunities (e.g. lab, project and performance classes, design studios) for those who can be on campus will be important.  
   * Even as lectures, recitations, seminars, and large group gatherings are delivered remotely, individuals who choose to be on campus may benefit from physically-distanced, in-person interactions among others wearing face coverings, in medium-sized and large spaces (e.g., psetting, office hours, working on projects, practicing performances, etc.). Such spaces and the management of appropriate population density are under consideration now. 
   * We donʼt yet know how we will house and room residential students in a de-densified scenario and may need to explore the implications of securing hotel spaces and keeping some buildings (e.g., Burton Conner and Eastgate) in use to house graduate students, undergraduate students, and/or as isolation space. Nor do we know when the Site 4 and New Vassar residence halls will open following construction delays, but anticipate this will not be until January at the earliest (these buildings provide \~450 beds each of additional capacity).
* Short and long-term impacts on the wellbeing of community members.
   * While we will make every effort to create a positive and special living community on campus, some individuals may feel more isolated and have difficulties coping with the new normal. Others may have difficult living situations off-campus if they are remote.
* Short and long-term impacts on the residential education model and experience and co-curricular learning.
   * There are uncertain impacts on internships, and travel-related learning.
   * We donʼt know the extent of necessary changes to the academic calendar and curriculum. 
* Community responses and reactions to the options.
   * We donʼt know how many undergraduate and graduate students may wish to defer, take a leave of absence, or stay remote under the conditions in which MIT has to operate this fall. In a recent survey, [when asked about the housing options they were exploring for fall](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnzthf4xbxc3xhz/housing%20options%20students%20are%20exploring.pdf?dl=0), about a quarter of continuing undergraduates checked “I would probably stay where I am now if MIT has online instruction and reduced campus operations (e.g., restricted access to campus; emergency housing policies).”    
 

**Steps MIT Can Take**

*Keeping in mind the* [*guiding principles*](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/principles-values/) *and logistical, temporal, and financial realities, the following are examples of steps that MIT could decide to take that might impact the viability of the potential options.*

* Consider requiring [regular, community-wide testing, tracing, and treating](https://idss.mit.edu/research/idss-covid-19-collaboration-isolat/)
   * Consider requiring testing on arrival/re-entry to campus and periodically thereafter. MIT Medical would be able to collect specimens for up to 5,000 viral tests per week.
   * Consider requiring  use of a contact tracing app to facilitate testing, tracing, and treating [if we could ensure that it was accurate and could protect privacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01264-1).
   * Continue to provide quarantine spaces and care for students and other campus residents who have a positive COVID-19 test.
   * Continue to integrate the evolving information and protocols published in the literature into our processes for any testing, tracing, and treating as feasible and appropriate.
* Adopt new policies, procedures, and educational campaigns that promote recommended practices and support compliance with public health guidelines:
   * Enhance access to hand washing stations, hand sanitizer, face coverings and work activity-specific PPE; required access control for spaces, etc. consistent with our policies.
   * Enhance cleaning and stocking by staff who maintain facilities (e.g., more frequent cleaning and sanitizing schedule, restocking sanitizing wipe and hand sanitizer stations, etc.).
   * Establish and communicate work-at-home policies and expectations.
   * Establish and communicate expectations and protocols for being on campus (e.g., conduct meetings electronically, even when on campus; requirement to wear a face covering in any shared space; practice physical distancing; criteria to be eligible to return to campus; reminders through signage; training on new expectations; using health monitoring technology; etc.).
   * Redesign spaces to help maintain physical distance (e.g., remove furniture and chairs; Plexiglass barriers; removing vending machines and reusable kitchen items).
   * Establish remote, hybrid, and physically-distanced teaching, learning, and working options. 
* Teach, learn, and work in new modalities. 
   * The entire MIT community responded quickly and effectively on short notice to the pandemic in spring 2020. Going forward, we will have more time to carefully plan and prepare. We will continue to invest in existing and new academic and well-being support structures for our students; this includes, for example, our [student success coaches](http://news.mit.edu/2020/student-coaching-calls-pandemic-0501) and [other virtual support resources](https://covid19.mit.edu/virtual-student-support-resources).
   * We will redesign not only our formal curriculum but also co-curricular and experiential learning opportunities (e.g., UROP) so that we will continue to offer these exceptional parts of the MIT experience. For classes and experiences that typically require and rely on access to the physical campus space to achieve the subject learning objectives, we can explore and offer alternatives (e.g., mailing kits of parts home). 
* Implement a phased or staggered campus repopulation plan.
   * We can strictly limit visitors to campus. 
   * We plan to ramp up the research enterprise under the following parameters:
      * Reduced occupancy and density levels for our buildings and labs as prescribed by our medical and public health professionals. PI and DLC operating plans will align and be benchmarked against these levels. 
      * Only researchers and staff needing to use the physical campus will be allowed back during the ramp-up process. Clearly, this need is subjective and thus a period of comment and discussion with the faculty is underway to plan phases of research ramp up that would increase the number of MIT ID holders coming to campus to conduct research each day. Researchers and staff who can work remotely will continue to do so until conditions as determined by our medical and health professionals allow them to return to campus. 
      * Individual PIs and DLCs will be empowered to structure their research activities in response to these new occupancy and density levels. Priority should be given to activities that can easily be scaled up or scaled down if necessary.
      * Core facilities, shared resources, and other services will be made available to facilitate research activities broadly, provided they can function safely and within the predetermined limits regarding occupancy and density.
      * Access to buildings (and, where possible, individual spaces within buildings) will adhere to approved PI personnel plans; only those individuals who are approved to enter buildings will be allowed to do so and will do so through specific building access locations and protocols.
      * Anyone who chooses to participate in on-campus research can be supplied with face coverings or PPE if needed. Face coverings or masks will be required to be worn while working in MIT buildings. On-campus personnel will follow physical distancing protocols as described in PI space planning documents and DLC plans for common spaces. They can also submit to a daily health attestation as well as possible health monitoring and testing.
      * Researchers, students, and staff returning to campus to conduct or support research may be expected to enroll in an online environmental, health, and safety training course to learn about how to maintain a safe and clean work environment in the current COVID-19 era conditions. 
* Create and promote new modes of operating for student life and hands-on learning opportunities as well as community-building programs.
   * New virtual study lounges and other study spaces (remote and physically-distanced in person) could be used to promote academic belonging, peer-learning, and camaraderie. 
   * New campus organizations and events (e.g., discussion groups, representative bodies, etc.) can help anticipate and manage the range of issues that will arise in a physically distanced academic year. 
* Adapt MITʼs business operations to all options.
   * Essential campus services must be staffed according to acceptable campus density parameters and guidelines for safe working conditions and safe commuting. The research ramp-up plans, educational plans, and other MIT programs cannot create an unacceptable burden on these functions or these campus service staff.  
 

**Important Things to Consider for All Options**

*We realize that assessing the information on this site is, in MIT tradition, like drinking from a firehose. With that in mind, the list below succinctly presents the most crucial factors that informed our analysis of options and will need to be heeded in any adaptation to those options or in developing new ones.*

**Health Risk**

* Health risk to the MIT community 
* Health risk to the broader community beyond campus  
 

**Education and Student Experience**

* Quality of educational offerings  
* Quality of lab, project-based, performance classes, and other academic experiential learning (e.g., UROP)
* Student academic progression (e.g., numbers of potential schedule dislocations)
* Extracurricular and residential education (e.g., clubs, organizations, athletics, FSILGs, etc.)
* Impacts on student life goals (e.g., desire to be with friends, experience the campus, distributional impacts)
* Equity impacts on students, staff, and faculty
* Impact on residential operations 
* Impact on FSILGs (fewer students will live in FSILG housing, and FSILG leaders and alumni are working with MIT to consider how housing in FSILGs will work in the various options being considered for the upcoming academic year)  
 

**Implementation**

* Ease of public health protocol implementation
* Ease of curricular implementation
* Ease of implementation behaviorally
* Preparedness for a ramp-up (e.g., in the event of a vaccine)
* Preparedness for rapid wind-down (e.g., in the event of a second wave of cases)
* Confidence in planning estimates
* Impacts on faculty/staff (e.g. workload, different working hours)  
 

**Broader Institute Impacts**

* Financial sustainability 
* Reputational impacts 
* Longer-term impacts (e.g., deferrals)
* Cambridge/Boston community economic impact",MIT thinking about next year,t3_gq19y8,38.0,0.97

Essentially this means that if you are an international student who is currently in the US, you have to stay in the US until you graduate (up to ""holidays"") or MIT won't pay you.

What I have been able to find out about this policy change so far:

\-This policy was quite likely forced on MIT by US immigration (vote!).

\-Students who want to return home in spite of this should be able to if they take a leave of absence for a semester, the issue is with paying students rather than the state of an F-1 or J-1 visa.

If anyone knows anything more on this, please leave a comment. If they can find anywhere on the MIT website where this change has been announced that would also be appreciated!

Edit: should be the US, not MA.

Suppose that each $ represents 10 dollars. As in $ means 0-10 dollar range, $$ means 10-20, etc. I'm accounting for tip, also this what I can remember from memory so it may not be 100% accurate. Please add your own suggestions! This list is not comprehensive or complete. It is just restaurants I have gone to and remembered atm.

&amp;#x200B;

* Cambridge Based
   * Five Spice | $$
      * Best and closest mala xian guo place near MIT. The food there is great and the price is very affordable. My go-to place for a long lunch during the day due to its proximity.
   * Mysterious White Food Truck Area 4 | $ - $$
      * It's shady but it's good. I don't know how they make it so good but the food truck parks right in front of Area 4 most days and there is always a line. It is a fast, cheap, delicious way to keep your stomach full especially if you have a tight schedule.
   * L'Verdes | $
      * Will fill you up. Will also take away your soul. Atleast if you get 10 subs they give you a free one.
   * Anna's Tacqueria | $ - $$
      * Is food. Will fill up stomach. Tastes decent I guess. Not a big fan of this kinda of food myself. Alot of people get it nevertheless. Good if you don't have time for anything else.
   * Thelonious Monkfish | $$ - $$$
      * Very expensive. It has sushi boats, fish dons and etc. Good place to bring your date. Wouldn't really go casually tho.
   * HMart Go Go Curry | $$
      * Amazing curry. It is fast, tastes good, and is in HMART so you'll be able to pick up snacks along the way.
   * HMart Sakura Ramen | $$
      * Same thing as Harambe curry. Closest ramen place to campus
   * Dumpling Daughters | $$
      * Pretty good asian food. I appreciate how clean it is and how efficient they make your food.  I like the food but it does not remind me of the stuff I normally eat, esp since alot of the stuff is premade.
   * Chipotle | $ - $$
   * Area 4 | $$
      * Good pizza place(heard from others). It is very close to campus. Never been there myself though.
   * The Smokeshop | $$
      * I really like their smoked meats and their sauce. The price is a little bit on the higher side but it definitely a change of taste compared to the other restaurants named here. I personally think it is worth it.
   * The Friendly Toast | $ - $$
      * A really friendly breakfast diner that makes amazing comfort food. 
   * Roxy's | $$
      * A close-by grilled cheese joint with great tots. I would personally think it is a lil overpriced esp the tomato soup but the taste definitely makes up for it.
   * Oath's | $$
      * Make your own pizza. Never enjoyed it but it is a good eat once in a while.
   * Saloniki's | $ - $$
      * Amazing pitas at this greek restaurant. It is probably as close to campus as you can get. The food is cheap and amazing. Students get free fries if shown ID.
   * Taco Bell  | $
      * \+1 rep for taste, -1 rep for diarrhea
   * Helmand  | $$ - $$$
      * Kinda expensive Afghan restaurants. Their lamb is amazing and I would definitely suggest trying here.
   * Pepper Sky | $$
      * Amazing Thai food. Although I never went there personally, ever club orders it for events.
   * McDonalds | $ - $$
      * Only for late-night shenanigans
   * Dumpling House | $$
      * Amazing Asian restaurant that is also very cheap. Comparable to 5 spice although I think Dumpling house is a little bit better. The only downside is its really up Mass Ave(closer to Harvard than MIT)
   * 430 Tavern | $$
      * Go here for Boston dine out week. The steak tip lunch is amazing, the meat is perfectly tender and the asparagus is amazingly seasoned.
* Boston Based
   * Santouka  | $$
      * The best ramen you'll find near campus. It is a 20 minute walk over the bridge. The line is very long so prepare for a wait. Do make sure to go in duos or by yourself since larger groups take longer to seat. (There is another one in Harvard that will seat you faster). Go here on a date lol
   * Kaju Tofu | $$
      * Amazing tofu soup place. My go-to place to eat when I'm in Boston. Definitely try this place out. Always get an egg in your soup.
   * Hsin Hsin's | $(lunch menu) - $$
      * Really cheap asian food that will give you diabetes or cancer. It tastes good but eat at your own risk.
   * Chef Chang | ?
      * Apparently the noodles are good? Never been before
   * Love Art Sushi | $$
      * Make your own sushi don place. It also offers hand rolls. I ate it a lot over the summer. The price is pretty affordable even with UROP pay.
   * Pad Thai Cafe | $ - $$
      * One of my favorite pad thai places I been to. I like the Indonesian Fried Rice alot. They give you alot of food compared to what you pay.
   * Wendy's | $ - $$
      * I love Wendy's chili's and baconator. What can I say.
   * Boston Burger Company | $$
      * Amazing burgers! Most of the burgers are very fatty and greasy and is impossible to fit in your mouth but it is soooo good. If you go at 4:20, the 420 burger(literally obesity burger) only costs 4.20.
   * Pour House | ?
      * ??? people I know always want to go so it must be good right???
   * Peach Farm | $$
      * Decent asian food place. Not sure if its worth the price since there are so many others which are better.
   * Dumpling Palace | $ - $$
      * This is the one on Mass Ave. The food is really bad. Go there if you're drunk and need to fill up your stomach
   * Haruka Ramen | $$
      * Outwayed by Santouka. It's not a proper ramen place since it also sells other noodles. Overall the quality is not that good. Source: my mom
   * Gourmet Dumpling House | $$
      * There is usually a long wait. The food is really good here especially the dumplings and xiao long bao. Would suggest going here, maybe on a date
   * Taiwan Cafe | $$
      * Can't actually remember much. It is average asian food. Nothing too particular but nothing too bad.
   * Dumpling Cafe | $$
      * Also average asian food. 
   * Double Chin | $$
      * I've only been here once. The food was okay. I went with my gf and I never thought about going back. If invited I would go back but I wouldn't go out of my own choice. Wasn't too memorable
   * Penang | $$
      * I always liked Penang even at home. I like the shrimp noodles but it is definitely an average restaurant taste wise.
   * Pho Pasteur | $$
      * Argued to be the best pho place in Boston. greatly debated
   * Pho Basil | $$
      * On Mass Ave. Another Pho place but this one is closer to campus. The food is good, especially if you want Viet food. The distance to campus is a plus but the taste is a bit lower than Pho Pasteur.
   * Hei La Moon | $$
      * Great dim sum place. Go here with a group and you'll have fun.
   * Tora Japanese Restaurant | $$
      * Amazing sushi/fish don. I discovered this by accident and it is a kinda small and in the ground. But don't be deceived. It is very clean inside and the taste is A1.
   * Quic Pic BBQ | $ - $$
      * I came here when I was hungry late at night after a haircut and the food is decent. It has cha sao(bbq pork). I liked it and am willing to go back again.
   * 5 Spices House | $$
      * Have you ever play Angry Bird's lite? Well 5 spice in Cambridge is angry birds and this 5 spice is pretty much the same thing but as that 5 spice. I would go to the other one though.
   * Ruckus | $$
      * Surprisingly a ramen place. The price is a lil high for what you get. I don't plan on going there again. The taste was not WOW! enough for me to remember too much.
* Allston Based
   * Bonchon | $$
      * Best fried chicken in Boston. Definitely go here once in your life
   * Dumpling Kingdom | $ - $$
      * Very average asian restaurant. Probably shouldn't go since there are wayyy better options
   * Kaju Tofu | $$
      * See above Kaju. Same thing, small differences in menu
   * Seoul Soulongtang | $$
      * Beef bone soup. Good to warming up on a cold day but I do feel like it is a bit bland.
   * Tasty Pot | $$
      * Amazing food. I really like this place and I try to come as much as I can. It is basically hot pot that they precook and most of it is spicy. 
   * Coreanos $ - $$
      * Korean/Mexican fusion. It is a very interesting taste but pretty good nevertheless
   * Le's Vietnamese Cuisine | $$
      * Taste isn't much better than the other Pho restaurants. It is too far to be noted.
   * Gyu Kaku | $$ - $$$
      * Best thing about this place is the unlimited KBBQ. Eat as much as you can! There is alot of meat and the taste is amazing! If you like meat definitely go here.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus Round(Bubble TeaPlaces)

* Kung Fu Tea
   * Down Mass Ave near Symphony,If you join ASA you get a discount
* Gong Cha
   * In chinatown, my favorite place in Boston
    * Update: there is also one in Cambridge Galleria
* Update: Abide
   * More expensive, unique flavored, kinda hipstery bubble tea store next to Darwins. 
* Chatime
   * It is good only if Gong Cha is closed since Gong Cha is just accross the street
* Teado
   * Cheap bubble tea, most clubs order from here for fundraisers
* Royal Tea
   * I think the price is a little bit higher than others. The taste is definitely unique. 

Also check out the bakeries in Chinatown! They are amazing, I love raisin bread and egg tart. Also Kalai has haircuts for $13 dollars. They do a great job at cutting hair although there always is a wait.

0.0,1587817626.0,0.0,mit,"So  I already made a post about this before, but felt like I needed the  input of others before I make a decision. I was admitted to Columbia,  Princeton, Yale, and MIT, and I am intending to study computer science  and economics. While this post is mainly meant for Yale and MIT, I am  still considering the others if you think one of them fits me more.

I'm  aware that these are both incredible institutions, so if you guys know  these universities, I would love it if you advised me mainly based on  fit, and the perceived culture on campus.

Here are a few things about me:

\-  I'm pretty academically well-rounded. I like math and science, but I  also LOVE the humanities. I enjoy writing essays where there is no wrong  answer as long as it's backed up.

\- My fascination with technology mainly comes from the things you can do with it (i.e. application)

\-  I feel that my main strengths are in speech and debate (did a lot of  MUN in HS). I am pretty politically engaged, and I would love to be in a  campus that is similar.

\-I am not  sure that computer science is my life's passion with ultimate  certainty, and later down the road I would much rather have an  executive/leadership role in a company than be a software engineer

\-  I am also a big fan of entrepreneurship, business, and economics, and  would love to take these as either a joint or secondary major. I am  interested in startups and would love to start one in college.

\-I am interested in a more collaborative atmosphere, rather than one that has toxic competition

\-I  am an extrovert- my favorite activities to do on a weekend are social. I  typically go out to town or party, but I am also interested in doing  similar social things on campus.

\-I  would personally prefer an urban environment like that of MIT or  Columbia rather than a suburban/smaller urban one like Yale or Princeton

\-  I'm also scared that the academic rigor of an institution like MIT will  make me hate my major more than an institution like Yale, especially  since I see myself much more as a founder/CEO with a tech background,  rather than a software engineer.

Also  as an aside, I still haven't received my financial aid package from  Yale. Do you guys think I should request an extension since I am  seriously considering it?",Help a super stressed out student decide- Yale vs MIT,t3_g7sp9u,0.0,0.47

Everyone around me says I'm completely crazy for choosing UD, but I think I have my reasons, I just don't know how valid they are. Before getting into the details, I'll say money is not an issue, I have not been on either campus and I did not actually participate in CP\* at all (kind of regret it but I truly thought MIT wasn't right for me then).

So far I kind of have these arguments for MIT as my parents/friends/current students/third aunt idk tell me: 

* interesting people, will motivate me much more than those even in UD honors
* workload made easier by ""shared suffering"" and collaboration (my high school was kind of like this as a STEM boarding school so I can kind of understand how this can be good)
* resources, connections, prestige (yes everyone mentions this when they talk about me not choosing MIT I don't know how much this really matters, probably more than I think ?)

My gripes about MIT that prevented me from considering it much: 

* WORK - I was a complete nerd last yr in 11th grade and studied for an olympiad possibly avg 5 hrs/day. It was fulfilling in the end but I realized it's definitely not how I want to live life. I couldn't do any hobbies, meet new people, gym, meditate/read for fun/try new things/be happier/etc, and so this year I stopped doing as much schoolwork (took only blowoff classes). I care about chemistry a lot still, it's just I don't want to be stuck studying all the time when (and this is how I perceive it) I could be at UD doing the same thing while actually becoming a better person. I really value my free time now and I think MIT would just kill it so fast
* I have a pipe dream of becoming a high school chemistry teacher (if I ever become extremely patient/talkative/understanding with time) and MIT's prestige doesn't mean anything here (?)
* Also may have a little impostor syndrome lmao but I don't think this is really big

I guess I realized that if I can get in a relaxed schedule, MIT is fine, but I think people have deluded me into thinking ""your life is so easy if you take the bare minimum, everyone at MIT overloads themselves!"" So my questions are

1. For a single-major ChemE, how possible is an average schedule of 8-9 hrs sleep/day, 1-2 hrs hw, 2 hrs non-academic hobby, 1 hr reading for fun, 1 hr gym? I might be completely crazy - is this possible at UD or similar?

I’m currently a sophomore in high school in Florida, and lately I’ve been in the mood of thinking about college and all that stuff. I’ve wanted to go to MIT for a few years now because I really love exploring mathematics and learning about how systems work and can be designed to solve problems, and also because the school’s culture is really attractive to me. Obviously it’s not easy to get in, which is what has me worried. I am so far a straight A student and I have already scored a 1550 on the SAT (800 math, 750 EBRW) so I’m not worried there, but after looking at the portfolios of a lot of people who have been recently admitted I feel like I’m not unique enough. Everyone I see keeps saying to focus on one area and be really good at it. So far for me that area is music; I was the pianist in the all state band this year and I’ve received several superior ratings from adjudicators in multiple organizations. But I am also an Eagle Scout and have experience doing things in multiple areas. I feel like I’m almost too well rounded. But I see portfolios of people who are less academically qualified than I am but they get in on the merit that they did something super unique, and I guess I’m just feeling really inadequate and worried that even with another year and a half I won’t be able to make it.

Hi, I'm a '24 choosing between the two schools in title. I am a super indecisive person and literally (literally!) have no idea which one I prefer. Thoughts?

If it helps -- I'm going in as a pure math major and likely pre-MD/PhD. If I go to Brown, I would likely double major in bio/math. I thrive on challenge and being with people who do, but I'm trying to balance that w/ pre-med requirements.

I'm quite social/extroverted and enjoy parties now and then, but I don't plan to drink much (and hope to be at a school where that's okay). I'm a pretty driven/focused person, and I like to be around people who are similar in that way (but collaborative more than competitive). I think ""social nerd"" describes me pretty well, though I'm not super nerdy.

MIT -- **Pros:** What drew me here is the fact that everyone is super driven and wants to make a difference, and research is great. I've made a bunch of friends already and feel like I would fit in very well with the community. I love the idea of having pset parties late into the night on whiteboards and talking about random cool math problems, even if they aren't related to class. **Cons:** I'm worried about the workload, sleep, and mental health, especially since I won't be able to place out of any classes there (my school is not very academic and doesn't offer APs). I also don't know how much time I'd have for extracurriculars.

Brown -- **Pros:** I love the open curriculum. There isn't grade deflation so pre-med might be easier. It also seems like it would be less stressful than MIT, and I could test into higher-level courses. The people seem quite humble and very friendly. **Cons:** I'm worried that I might not find ""my people"" in the same way/the community might not be as good of a fit. At my current HS, I've sometimes felt like it was hard to connect with classmates bc they had very different interests than me. I'm pretty clear this wouldn't be an issue at MIT, not convinced about Brown. I also don't know how strong the pure math program is/what research is like.

To the members of the MIT community,

The day before I was set to graduate from my Caracas high school, the city suffered a major earthquake. Buildings collapsed. There were serious casualties. Suddenly, it was impossible, physically and emotionally, to hold the traditional graduation ceremony we had all been counting on. 

I still remember the pain and disappointment – so I write with special sympathy and great regret to let you know that, in a world so disrupted by Covid-19, it is clear we cannot conduct our traditional in-person celebration of Commencement, Hooding and Tech Reunions in late May. 

To the Class of 2020 and all of our graduating students, to your proud families and faculty friends, and to our reunion-year alumni: I know you have been holding out hope that the recognition you have earned might still be presented in the usual way. We have all been hoping. So I expect this news may be sharply disappointing.

But I promise you, we are going to reinvent these wonderful rituals to honor and celebrate with you, in the best MIT spirit, in ways that make sense in this most unusual time.

Getting the details right will be important, and we know you will have questions; as plans develop, we will share updated information with everyone affected. (And if you already ordered regalia, you will receive a follow-up communication.) 

For now, here are the broad strokes:

To honor the incredible hard work and accomplishments of our graduating students, Commencement 2020 will occur in two parts: 

An online event on May 29 to confer degrees and to celebrate our graduates. Those who plan our usual Commencement will co-design this program with our elected student leaders and some faculty.
An in-person celebration, to be held at MIT at some point in the future. The students, faculty and staff on our Commencement Transition Committee – whom we charged to develop the programming for MIT Commencement in 2021 and beyond – will begin imagining the possibilities for this special Class of 2020 event, under the leadership of committee chair Professor Jim Poterba and bolstered by new student leaders. Proposing that graduates travel back to campus naturally raises questions around equity and financial burdens, so we will do our best to plan with these concerns in mind.
To our graduating students: If you have ideas for these events, please share them with us and your elected student leaders at CommencementIdeas@mit.edu.

Although 2020 Tech Reunions will not occur as they usually would, once we understand the larger circumstances more fully, we will explore ways to honor class milestones and bring the community together again. I am especially grateful to the many class leaders whose energetic outreach – over many years, and in distinctive ways in this challenging time – continues to keep classmates connected to each other and to the great global family of MIT.

If you were planning to attend Reunions, the MIT Alumni Association will be in touch soon to help you navigate these changes.

*   *   *

As the Covid-19 crisis unfolds, you will continue to hear from us – a lot. We are trying to learn what works best in terms of frequency and channels, and we hope to find the right path between “too much” and “not enough.” We will convey practical updates, and we will honor the human stories.

For now, I will simply say that what I most remember from that long-ago earthquake is the people around me – family, neighbors, teachers, friends – shaken to the core, but pulling together to help, with remarkable generosity, fortitude and kindness. 

Those memories echo exactly what I have seen at MIT through the upheaval of these past weeks: students, staff, postdocs and faculty adjusting rapidly to this disconcerting new reality and doing everything they can to help each other and contribute to the greater public good.

In this difficult situation, the people of MIT have already endured and accomplished a great deal. The weeks and months ahead may hold harder challenges. From what I have seen, I have every expectation that our community will meet those new challenges with the same patience, courage, selflessness and grace.

May you all stay safe and well.

hi y'all. more context about me in response to u/ccb621's comment
- I don't really know what field or subjects interest me, beside the vague notion that I've found that I enjoyed the math, cs, and econ classes I've taken (6.08, 6.042, 18.01/2/3, 14.01).
- I don't have any practical knowledge of what jobs I would get after undergrad. My super idealistic dream would be to work in econ/policy research because from afar or from a completely naive standpoint I think I would enjoy it.

A call for help: 

Has anyone considered using a raspberry pi or other microcontroller to hack something like a CPAP machine or other pressurized air device (like SCUBA gear) to make a DIY ventilator? This could save a lot of lives. Our current supply is in the thousands, not enough by far. 

As a healthcare provider, the settings we adjust are: inspiration/expiration pressure, volume of air delivered, and ratio of inhale/exhale times. Some people require oxygen to be added. 
Patients who are incubated are sedated so they generally have no respiratory drive at all. 

BTW: CPAP is continuous positive airway pressure, which helps those who stop breathing during sleep and they have adjustments for pressure only. 

Please share this with other maker communities as we need to think outside the box.

With the declaration of a state of emergency by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the doubling of Covid-19 cases in the Greater Boston area, the Institute is increasingly concerned for the safety of the community and is therefore taking extraordinary steps.

First, we are cancelling all classes tomorrow, Friday, March 13. This decision was made after consultation with Academic Council, the faculty officers, and MIT Medical.

We are also strongly advising all undergraduate students to accelerate their move out plans. MIT will reimburse travel change expenses and new reservation costs up to $500 for undergraduates who move up their departure to before Sunday, March 15 at midnight. Additional resources for an accelerated move out, including free pick up and storage of belongings, can be found here.

All students who have requested an exception from moving off-campus and have not yet received a determination will be contacted tomorrow with decision

MIT housing just sent out an email saying unregistered students have to vacate housing by Feb. 28 (friday). This is the only notice they’ve sent (to me, at least).

So I’m confused by this email—it says to go the registrar if you’re planning on being a fully registered student. Which I am, but the reason I’m not currently registered is due to a financial registration hold (which  my family and I have been trying to get cleared, but in the meantime I’ve been receiving grades for assignments/exams for 3 classes/36 units).

Would going to the registrar even help my case? I feel like the only thing that could help is going to SFS (since they placed the hold on my account), but SFS has not been helpful whatsoever in the past, so I don’t really think they’d be able to assist me.

I’m planning on setting up an appointment with housing services, but I’m afraid that won’t help either. I don’t know if I’ll be able to meet with them by the 28th and I don’t know if they’ll force me to leave even if I can’t meet with them by them. I don’t really know where i’m going to go on such short notice. I wish MIT would have sent this email out earlier—I’m not saying it’s not my fault for having a hold, but the deadline to remove myself and my belongings is in two days.

I guess I’m just looking for advice? I admit I don’t know how to navigate this situation, and I really don’t know what to if I do get kicked out of housing. If I do get kicked out, I would still want to attend classes (so that I can have grades for when I ultimately get the hold cleared), but that would likely mean being homeless.",housing/registration hold help,t3_fa3eno,17.0,1.0

Over the past year and a half I have been reading a lot about retiring early on the /r/fire subreddit and reading about real estate and stock investing. My goal is to retire by 32/33 (i.e. 10 years after I graduate), which, based off my research, is entirely possible with the typical engineering salaries and aggressive savings.

However, most of my friends in my friend group at MIT can't really comprehend why anyone would want to retire so early. Some even sort of judge me for it and lowkey call me lazy or selfish. I, on the other hand, can't really see why anyone *wouldn't* want to retire early. So we are in an impasse.

I sort of suspect it's just the nature of the type of people who apply and get accepted to MIT.  Most of my friends seem to really love what they do and want to help the world. Unfortunately, I never really found anything that has inspired me, or at least not enough to make me want to work 9-5+ for the next 40 years of my life. I feel sort of bad for not having found my ""passion"", but I also sort of feel like more people at any other school would understand me, and it's just a function of the fact that I'm at MIT that my friends look at me strangely when I tell them of my early retirement goals. 

Anyways, I'm reaching out here to see if there is anyone else in the MIT community with similar ambitions and/or experiences. I'd love to connect and/or hear your thoughts.

0) If I'm not sure if I'm qualified for an advertised UROP opportunity but I'm still interested in it, should I reach out and ask? Being unsure in this case is like having the prereq listed be proficiency in Python and me having worked with Python but not for a  formal project.  
1) What does ""demonstrable previous experience of intensive computational/empirical work"" mean as a prerequisite for an econ UROP?  Would having done data analysis for a year-long high school research project count?  
2) What would be useful previous experience to put in a resume for a UROP about writing a review of literature in social sciences? I've written a review of lit before but it was for a STEM research project, and I haven't done social science-related writing ever.

0.0,1574182350.0,27.0,mit,"Hi folks, alum here. When I was in the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program, they urged us to read the essay [A Message to Garcia](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/hubbard1899.pdf). The essay is mostly a late-1890s polemic against workers who would take a task and then spend their day at the pub. But the key takeaway for a younger me was:

&gt; You, reader, put this matter to a test: You are sitting now in your office—six clerks are within your call. Summon any one and make this request: “Please look in the encyclopedia and make a brief memorandum for me concerning the life of Corregio.”

&gt; Will the clerk quietly say, “Yes, sir,” and go do the task?

&gt; On your life, he will not. He will look at you out of a fishy eye, and ask one or more of the following questions:

&gt; 1) Who was he?

&gt; 2) Which encyclopedia?

&gt; 3) Where is the encyclopedia?

&gt; 4) Was I hired for that?

&gt; 5) Don’t you mean Bismarck?

&gt; 6) What’s the matter with Charlie doing it?

&gt; 7) Is he dead?

&gt; 8) Is there any hurry?

&gt; 9) Shan’t I bring you the book and let you look it up yourself? 

&gt; 10) What do you want to know for?

&gt; And I will lay you ten to one that after you have answered the questions, and explained how to find the information, and why you want it, the clerk will go off and get one of the other clerks to help him find Garcia.

At the time, I took this to heart alongside “Impossible is Nothing” and “Sleep is for the Weak”.

So when my first job asked me to write an API integration with UnionPay, what did I do about the fact that the API docs were in Chinese and so were the error messages? Did I raise a red flag about the schedule risk and get the docs professionally translated so my team could deliver the project and it's additional revenue? No, I stayed up late in the office with Google Translate. The project never shipped.

I was fired for poor performance before the year’s end.



My lessons:

 * Your role as an engineer is to isn’t to search through jungle and sugarcane alone. Your job is to muster the resources you need to see the job done. So yes, ask the other clerk.

 * Learn to [Ask Good Questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) which empower your colleagues to successfully help you.

 * Understand the “Why” behind a task, so you can exercise skilled judgment about what trade-offs to make. If writing a memo, know your audience, why they need to read it, and what you can omit from the source material.

 * Understand the urgency and impact of a task so you know what sort of resources are appropriate to spend. That includes allocating your own attention. (See also: the Eisenhower Matrix)

 * Proactively clear up misunderstandings. If you were just discussing German politics, don’t write a memo on Italian renaissance painters because you blindly followed a non-sequetur request. 

 * Know your team’s strengths and weaknesses. If a colleague Charlie would be stronger at writing about Italian art, then be clear on whether or not you should pitch-hit for him or have him review your work.

 * Get good food, exercise, and sleep because [your brain is made of meat](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html)

Now I read at the beginning of the book used in 18.700 (the book is Linear algebra done right, Sheldon Axler) something like ""this should be the second course you take on linear algebra"", so I guess it assumes previous knowledge.

Hello. I am 18 year old high school student with very good grades and big ambitions from Serbia. I'm interasted in chemical engeneering and have been working as an undergraduate researcher on Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy, University in Belgrade; department of organic chemisty (despite being in high school) for past 2 and a half years. Now where's the catch? Generally speaking, price to monthly income ratio in Serbia is quite off and working conditions are quite bad (I won't be bothering you about living conditions in Serbia but it can be Googled easly how bad the situation is). Not a lot of funding goes to science which makes any long term research nearly impossible. We are using long expired chemicals, some of them are over 50 or 60 years old, malfunctioned instruments etc. I was okay with all of this until recently, our storage fridge caught fire and all my progress got lost in flames. I got nothing now. It is important to mention that our 'chemical storage fridge' was just a plain household fridge.  I talked with few colleagues and they suggested me to inquire about MIT. I've sent many e-mails to MIT staff but so far got only auto-replies. So i found this subreddit and now im curious what i need to be qualified to apply for MIT. It is also important to notice that average salary here is around 300USD. I'm not in the average range but still I'm not even close to afford college in US, so I'm wondering if there are any scholarships that could cover university expenses. I would like to get feedback from both staff and students if possible.

Thanks kind reader for helping me out!

TL;DR I'm a highschool student who is interasted in chemical engeneering. I'm a fulltime undergraduate researcher but due to lack of fund investment in Science in Serbia and general lack of interest for science I'm seeking for MIT. Monthly income is many times lower that of average US salary so I won't be able to afford to attend MIT unless i get some form of scholarship.

Nevertheless, I’d like to start with 106B instead of A :P so for someone like me, if I use my time to catch up on CS content right now, is this plausible, and if so, how exactly should I go about doing so?

(I remember someone in this sub mentioning that taking Stanford’s online lectures for 106A and then practicing on Leetcode is probably sufficient, and that’s what I’ve been doing. But Stanford’s old online lectures for 106A are all Java, and I know 106A is in Python now, so is this still a good idea?)

(And yes I did create an entire alt to ask this question)

Edit: wow I really did not expect this many people to answer lol. I’m so grateful for everyone’s feedback! As of right now I’m leaning towards starting with 106A. I still plan on learning what I can before I begin college, and maybe maybe I’ll do 106B if I do feel great in fall, but everyone here has made it clear that it’s fine to start with 106A, and there’s no need for me to rush myself (especially in my first quarter where I’ll need time to adjust to college life presumably).

there is also the side factor that these units would have been in classes that all felt pretty meaningless/purposeless, which may have been why i felt so much less motivation than on campus. also, i am doing way more extracurriculars this year.

To say that I am disappointed by the lack of solidarity from the Stanford community, would be an understatement.

I implore you to think about our equal moral worth as human beings, and more than that, about our shared claim to the Stanford experience. Have we not all studied in Green Library, snuck onto the roof at MemChu, ate a delicious hot dog at Caspar dining? Does this mean nothing to you?

The vitriol and anger currently circulating will engender harrowing consequences for our institution and for the free market system. If left unchecked, I fear this company’s IPO may be blocked, and they could even face delinquency. Need I remind you of how Stanford has [fallen so drastically short](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ps2PNZh) in recent global metrics?

Although I'd appreciate any advice or comments, soliciting them isn't my intention.

I'm currently living on campus with my friends. I love them all; they're incredibly chill, full of energy and fun to be around. But as an international student, I feel out of place. There are so many references that go over my head, like the cartoons and TV shows they watched growing up, the music hits of middle school and vines that I've never been exposed to. It feels really hard to relate or contribute to conversations. Often, I feel like I have no opinions about things. My friends would debate which Miley Cyrus song is the best banger or which Disney channel actor/actress turned to be the hottest as they grew up. I've never really thought about those things, and don't understand the circumstances that would force one to, yet my friends seem to have immediate strong opinions about these things and have come up with lines of reasoning explaining their positions. Coupled with the fact that half the time I don't know what they're debating, it always feels like I'm just an observer in the friend group. I feel like they forget I exist, and by extension I feel like an outsider.

It doesn't help that I already have issues with active listening, vocabulary recall or expressing myself on the spot. English is not my first language, and I've only been conversing in it for a few years. This is also exacerbated by the fact that 18 years of living with a manipulative, hot-tempered mom has taught me to be agreeable and actively seek to please the people around me. I often just nod, smile or laugh, not knowing what for. These reflexes seem to be programmed in me. Whenever I try to overcome them, try to be true to myself, I'm hit with self-worth issues. Nothing about my life, at least to me, seems worth sharing. I don't have any funny anecdotes, while my friends always seem to have something funny that's happened to them recently. Adding to that, I hate my body, every bit of it. Although I know that my friends don't view my as ugly per se, they always throw around the word ""fat"" negatively. It makes me question if that connotation carries in the way the see me.

Perhaps the only time where I'm truly able to be ""me"", is when I'm drunk or high. So whenever I have the chance to, I always get really drunk, and try to get everyone around me to be drunk. It's the only time where I know I have an excuse if I say something that people would conventionally deem stupid or of no value to the conversation. Heck, my friends would just laugh because they're drunk. It's the only time where I can say the word ""like"" six times in the same sentence because I don't know what the English word for the specific thing I'm trying to describe is. People would think I'm just too drunk, that I'm not dumb. This has been very unhealthy because drinking alcohol or smoking weed seem to ruin my mood for the next few days.

So, even though I'm surrounded by people I love and admire, who I know I can count on, I feel alone. I don't know how I'd ever bring this up to them. Hell, saying this makes me question if they really see me as a friend or they just keep me around because I'm a ""generally nice person"". And the thing is, I know they're good people, but I also know that they wouldn't know how to respond or act if I ever told them this. I don't even know how to begin expressing myself, like would I call a ""friend group meeting"" and put myself under the spotlight? That just seems too dramatic. Even if I manage to do that, I know the moment I start to speak, my entire vocabulary will just disappear, my thoughts and feelings will no longer feel valid or worth listening to. I can't bear the feeling of making anyone feel even a little bit bad or sad. My whole life prior to Stanford was walking on egg shells trying not to trigger my mom, not to have her throw shit and break shit, not to hear her scream and stop talking to me for days on end.

All of these things, and many other things, compounded with school work and fucking PWR2 (that seems to incorporate even more work than a normal year would have) serves only to fuel sixty different voices in my head that I have no control over. I can't stop thinking. I can't stop hating myself, hating the circumstances that made me the way I am, hating every piece of my existence. Closing my eyes, and imagining my existence melt away is the only thing that brings me peace. I don't know what to do with myself. I've been trying so hard, but there's very little left in me. I'm depleted.

I know a lot of people say that you really don’t need to land any opportunities your first summer as it really doesn’t matter, but I’ve honestly been so unproductive this school year that doing nothing over the summer will prolly make me feel worse. 

So I’m looking to apply to some internships! I don’t think I have enough experience for anyone to hire me in an Econ position (I’ve only taken Econ 1), but I’ve taken CS106A and 106B and I’m using this quarter to learn data manipulation using Python. 

The only issue is that I have no clue where to start.  I was going to go for the Stanford Global Studies internship in Hong Kong (CS education), but I still haven’t asked found a recommender, so I think that opportunity is a dud.

I'll be applying to the ICME masters program next year, and I am looking for advice on whether I should apply to the data science vs. computational finance track. I am a CS/Stats major with SWE internships, so my profile is much more suited for the data science track. However, I am seeking a masters because I want to transition into quant finance, so my top choice is comp. finance, but I have 0 prior internships in finance.

Some questions I have are:

1. Which track should I apply to, given that (i) my top choice is the finance track, (ii) I have no finance work experience, and (iii) my profile is much more relevant for data science?
2. Is it possible to switch tracks once you're in the program? If so, I am thinking it might be a good idea to apply to data science, but I've also heard there are far more applicants for DS than there are for finance, so I might have better chances applying to finance in this case.

I loved the quirky irreverence and the accomplished peers. But I can’t stand the pressure and lack of empathy just because you go to Stanford. It’s a horrible place to fail. I can't stop the bleeding. It's a fit for the best students. There is little room for anyone else. I may need to leave because of it but before I do - has any one found a way past this? It seems like a serious issue that we never talk about. Posted this on Cardinal Confessions but it’s not a place for serious discussion. I need some advice on what to do. Do I stay or should I find another place where I can heal?

I suffer from severe suicidal depression for almost all of my life and I tried to kill myself. I got hospitalized. It didn't help. I remember my roommate throwing feces at the wall and yelling how he needed to tell Obama to retrieve an ancient artifact in Africa to save the world. One inmate routinely stole the clothes of other inmates. He would run around wearing them screeching unholy sounds. Another inmate followed me around threatening to kill me. During my week there, I was awakened by deafening psychotic screaming at nothing and no one every morning. My psychiatrist thinks I suffer PTSD from that experience. I routinely wake up screaming in the middle of the night after having nightmares about being stuck there again. I also got kicked out of Stanford. I tried to seek help in my hometown. When I told a therapist about my attempted suicide, she felt sad. But when I told her I went to Stanford. She told me to perk up because my life wasn’t so bad because Stanford has a lot of opportunities. She told me people would be so impressed that I went to Stanford. I could get a job and find a spouse and that’d be the end of it. We also did this fun exercise where I listed all the reasons why I wanted to commit suicide. For each reason I listed, she would tell me that they were invalid. Every time I would veer into a reason, she would remind me I could get a spouse and a job. Not a great job or spouse but just anyone and any job. I returned to Stanford. When I told my psychiatrist in Palo Alto I was worried about my grades (bottom 5%), she told me I shouldn’t worry and that I (a low-income student of color) was being another entitled Stanford student for worrying about grades so much. She told me that the Stanford name was so prestigious and everyone would want to hire a person with a fancy Stanford degree. She told me that Stanford people will always get jobs. Instead of listening to me, she claimed I was being ridiculous. She accused me of only wanting to get good grades because I craved validation from my teachers to compensate for insecurity. She pushed this outrageous claim despite evidence to the contrary and the fact that I needed to worry about my grades because I was on the verge of failing out. I later went on academic probation because I couldn't get out of bed to take my finals. I had my first internship rescinded because I didn’t meet GPA requirements.  I told my TA I was having trouble turning in assignments and going to class because I couldn’t get out of bed and was still adjusting to the odd impacts of extremely potent medication. He said that it was all my fault for struggling in school and that I had made extremely poor decisions which would have very little impact on my life. He talked about how much harder his undergrad at Berkeley was. He went on and on about how Berkeley was superior because there was no hand-holding and I was a privileged Stanford undergrad who cries because I can’t get what I want. He told me that the only difference between Stanford and Berkeley is that Berkeley had actual bite and that I would be kicked out of Berkeley had I gone to Berkeley instead. He told me at Berkeley 30% of students fail each class. The strong survive as the numbers dwindle but everyone develops real respect for each other because vast numbers of people fail out of Berkeley. He told me that if I couldn’t take insults I should leave engineering because real engineers tell it like it is. He yelled at me saying I should have majored in something like the humanities where people are always handing out compliments and only say positive happy things.

The culture is always happy. No one talks about how they’re struggling. I find it hard to make friends once they know the shit I’ve been through. One person told me “We can’t be friends because you are mentally ill and don’t have your shit together”. I told someone I had attempted suicide. They told me they didn't want to be around me because they ""didn't want to get run over by the crazy train and you'll do nothing with your life."" I told my friend that I was having trouble getting out of bed and was suicidal. My friend told me that I just need to be more studious and everything will all be fine. I'll never forget my friend telling ""You just need to do the work. It's easy."" I told some people that I was thinking of killing myself and they brushed it off as me trying to seek attention. I remember making some ""friends""  early in an intro engineering class. We did great until the midterm when I struggled to grasp the material and function once my health deteriorated. I couldn't put on a mask at that point in the quarter and came to problem set sessions so exhausted I couldn't figure anything out. I wasn't copying answers or anything. I just stopping contributing to the group's formulation of solutions and was confused at everything. After that, they began to ghost me. I finally ran into one of them. They told me off explaining ""I thought you knew something because you were excited about the class. But it's apparent you know nothing. I have no use for you in my life."" It’s as if people just want to be friends so that can network for prestigious careers later on. Stanford is dying. It's increasingly becoming a pre-professional tech feeder school where the already privileged can network some more; grab a few big titles before launching into big soulless tech company #1. There's still a culture at Stanford full of excited, passionate,  and irreverent students who want to learn everything possible. I'll never forget taking shots and drunkenly arguing about moral relativity with a Rhodes Scholar. I'll never forget discussing quantum physics with a Hertz Fellow over a game of billards. I'll never forget the times I stayed up late discussing fun finance schemes. I'll never forget launching a balloon into orbit with my dorm just because we could. I hold these memories dear but they are becoming increasingly extinct as my life unravels. When I was doing well and had a future, I benefitted from the passionate students and drive to do something great. But when I need real friends to cry with - there’s no one. It’s as if this entire university is becoming a place for networking into flashy careers. Fake smiles and fake California valley girls abound.

This place is a go-go-go atmosphere for the best students. There is no room for anyone else. We have grade inflation and support but the mentality is very much “You have so much so people dictate that you should be not just doing well but really, really, really on top of the world.” Here's the thing about Stanford, you have so much so if you happen to fail then it's your fault. Even if it's because of things that were your not your fault or outside of your control, you're expected to overcome them no matter what because it's you know Stanford. I get no sympathy from my peers for my struggles. I was an engineering major. I struggled in it but pushed on believing that it was for me. I was in every office hours. Spent 20-30 hours on so many of my problem sets. When I told students and professors this, they told me to start earlier and that I was being lazy. Professors are resentful of our safety net. I once asked a question and the professor told me Stanford holds my hand a lot but this is ridiculous. This question is so stupid that 99% of real engineers would have googled it up before asking it. Professors and graduate students hate the shit out of undergraduates. They’re generally awful teachers because they’re human beings going through a brutal and inequitable system. My friend TA’ed for a professor and he told me that the professor would take photos of failed undergrad exams so he could laugh at it and feel better about himself when he was going through a hard time. There is no real development. You really have to do it on your own. Only the very prepared kids can take advantage of Stanford. The chemistry program at my large underresourced public high school was awful and didn't prepare me at all. I took a freshman chem introsem to learn without pressure. When the professor found out I didn't know what photolithography was - he was shocked and told me that I was a moron. He told me that ""we should get an x-ray to scan your head to see if you have a brain"". He would often interject into class periods about how he was shocked I didn't learn about chemistry. I would try to explain I came from an underresourced high school but he wouldn't have any of it. He kept on driving onto my chemistry ignorance to embarrass me and laugh at basic concepts that I didn't know. He would constantly cold call on me in order to expose my ignorance. Never in the entire quarter did he cold call anyone else. I asked him to stop embarrassing me in front of the entire class. He responded by yelling ""It's the truth!"". There’s a safety net and you’ll graduate but it just feels like I’m grinding and barely staying afloat but not really getting any mentorship. I saw all the wrong signs but failed to steer clear because suffering is social currency in engineering departments.  I stayed up 48 hours for one of my projects. I had a professor chew me out for showing up late to lab because I couldn’t get out of bed. I went on academic probation because I couldn’t get out of bed to take any of my finals. The staff aren't generally great. Before I got hospitalized, I went to see my summer housing director for support. She had the empathy of a brick wall. She told me how great it is to be at Stanford and how privileged I am since I can get a cushy tech job at fancy big name companies like Facebook, Google, Palantir and so on. After I returned from my forced leave, I had to meet with a residence dean for months. I already had a therapist but she contacted me biweekly for meetings. She was just so patronizing. I felt like a misbehaving 3rd grader in the principal's office. She was checking up on me constantly to make sure I wasn't a liability for the school instead of being an actual resource. I had tried to kill myself and she told me that at least we're not in Afghanistan - we're at Stanford. I think she was trying to say we have more resources but it felt tone-deaf. I was constantly hearing ""at least it could be worse"" but it made me feel like my suffering didn't matter because there was always worse out in the real world. It's demoralizing to hear. How are you supposed to succeed in the real world if you can't make it in a cushy place like Stanford? Why live if life is going to get worse than failing at Stanford? I saw an academic advisor. I told her I was scared of failing out and that at any other school I would have failed out - basically what my TA told me. She laughed and reaffirmed that I would have failed out at any other school.

When I was okay, Stanford felt amazing but when I wasn’t okay (which is a lot of the time), Stanford felt god awful. I do believe Stanford is a great place and the best school in the world but it's not a place for struggling students or anyone who happens to stumble. Before I apply for additional quarters of financial aid, I wonder if I should because Stanford is such an awful place to fail. When I tell people I go to Stanford, people are impressed but people really assume that my life is set. This kills me. My life is not set.

I am a low-income student of color who grew up in the projects. My parents are refugees. I worked throughout all of high school to help our family stay afloat because my father became disabled and couldn’t work. I grew up thinking gunshots in the night are normal. I dressed so poorly - that I received donations in my backpack one day because concerned teachers were worried that I was going to become homeless.

We talk about how privileged Stanford kids are but it hurts because I don’t feel like a human deserving empathy because I have the Stanford name. To them, Stanford means that I am a privileged elite whose life is set. As if going to Stanford can undo the trauma of being a poor person of color in America. Once you go to Stanford, you'll never be an underdog ever again no matter how disadvantaged your background was coming in. I know people who had private K-12s and extremely wealthy parents growing up. Somehow I am the more privileged person in society's eyes because I went to Stanford and they went to state schools. I seriously wonder if I can pick myself back up again. Stanford was home for me but I'm starting to think it was worst possible place for me to attend. We talk about privilege but don’t talk about the serious detriments it has on healing and failure. I wonder if I should do it here or elsewhere. I don’t really don’t have much to look forward to in life. I don't think I'm meant to be happy. I have lost the rat race to pump as much dopamine as possible into a three pound slab of meat in your skull. I want to be as sentient as the stars and the stones. I just want the hurt to stop.

I'm seriously considering taking a gap year (GY) before I enter university. (My school has done an honorable but poor job at keeping the regular caliber of my schoolwork high, and I feel a tad intellectually/academically stunted. I've also been online for a whole year now and don't want to make it two.) I have tentative plans to work/intern for most of the 15 months between HS graduation and the start of my freshman year. I am also looking for some months-long scholarship/ work-and-travel programs that are fun and intellectually engaging (LMK if you know of any!).

I'm a little uneasy to take a gap year, admittedly. Given the current geopolitical climate, innumerable complications due to the Pandemic, and my corporate inexperience, I feel that I might have very limited options. Another thing is money— my parents, understandably, are not cool with paying for all of my expenses (like rent and food) especially if the job I'm working is lower-paying and I'm essentially losing money as well. I would prefer to go abroad, but the chances of doing so could dwindle in the coming months. 

So my questions are (assuming SU allows me to defer a year)—
1. To those who have taken GYs, did you do internships/scholarship programs? If so, where?
2. Where do you think I should continue my search for GY activities?
3. Is extracurricular enrichment at all the best route to go during a gap year?

### Deadline Sunday, Jan. 17 (11:59pm PST)

Are you passionate about **global development**? Do you want to learn more about global poverty and effective interventions? Apply to join One for the World’s Global Development Fellowship this winter to go in-depth into the topic of global development - we will focus on the key issues the world is facing right now in tackling global poverty. This fellowship will feature **1-on-1 mentorship, speaker events, career workshops, and mixers** to help you gain more perspectives towards this topic and meet other passionate, lovely humans. 

### What does this fellowship look like?

The fellowship will focus on a different aspect of global development each week. You will get assigned a group and a mentor to participate in weekly discussions. There will also be speaker events, career workshops, and mixers throughout the fellowship.

Topics in the fellowship include:

* **Moral agency** in global development - is it wrong not to help?
* **Economics** behind global development - how well do we understand the problem?
* **Global health and interventions** \- how can we minimize the harms of preventable diseases to the global poor?
* **Philanthropy and its effectiveness** \- what is the most effective way of helping the global poor? 
* **Human rights** \- how do first world countries and organizations like the UN affect the problem?

### Who are we?

One for the World @ Stanford is a student group dedicated to ending extreme poverty by revolutionizing charitable giving. Those in the U.S. and Stanford students especially are often the highest earners in the world, with a significant potential for outsized impact. By educating others about effective giving, we thus hope to improve the lives of people around the world.

We are a chapter of [One for the World](https://www.1fortheworld.org/), an international nonprofit organization dedicated to this same purpose. Since 2014, One for the World has motivated thousands of students to take a pledge to donate 1% of their income and has donated over $750,000 to effective charities.

The Viktor Zhdanov Fellowship gets its name from a Ukrainian virologist who was largely responsible for eradicating smallpox. He was the deputy minister of health for the Soviet Union and developed a visionary plan to eradicate the disease, which the WHO agreed to form a campaign around. 

**Questions?** 

Please reach out to [emma123@stanford.edu](mailto:emma123@stanford.edu) or [jchen23@stanford.edu](mailto:jchen23@stanford.edu) for any questions about the fellowship or One for the World @ Stanford.

I just finished my first quarter here at Stanford. I made a horrible decision during the last test of one of my classes, which ultimately resulted in the professor to write a letter of concern to the office of community standards, stating that I violated the Honor Code.

At this point, I am past the denial phase and I plan to accept the potential charges of my case.

My questions about how do I move on? I mean I know it is my first quarter here at Stanford and during my really emotionally devastating and stressful attempt to fight this process, I realized that my consequences were a lot less worse than I made them out to be and only felt more anxious about it because it seemed so bad.

I plan on retaking the class next quarter so my GPA is not complete trash. 

But I wanted to know if anyone understands how the process works beyond accepting the charges. 

I wanted to know what the possible consequences were. The judicial counselor has yet to file charges, but is it possible that the sanction agreement with them is negotiable if I don’t want to go to a panel, I mean if I chose the Early Resolution Option. My professor painted my actions and that of others involved as something that is worse than it actually is and I was wondering if the OFCS sees the standard  punishment as something that has to be done, or different for every individual case.

My actions involved indirectly mentioning a sequence used for a particular question of a test on a public platform and I was identified.

Long term, do you think that this sort of action is something that is relevant to Coterm applications. When I first signed the Honor Code earlier in the school year, I didn’t completely understand its nuances. If I do a complete 180, do you think it is something I have to disclose to certain departments. I am not interested in medical school or law school, both of whom require disclosing Honor Code violations, but do others ask about it. I mean, I do not think I’ll be suspended for a quarter and I don’t have to explain retaking an entry level class right?

Also is an Honor Code violation something that is required to disclose to research opportunities or internships, or Stanford study abroad programs. I am undecided and what stressed me out the most about this process was the fact that I closed these doors.

 Since English would be a BA. and CS would be a BS. would i be able to double major as I had hoped? Would that just become a BAS and then we’d be allowed to pursue both? Or how does that work? Would it not be allowed?

At Stanford, back when it was in-person, I was constantly speaking English, from smalltalk in lecture, to random late night philosophical discussions, to commiserating in office hours.

Since I'm at home in virtual school, I basically lost the ability to speak English. BTW, English is my most ""advanced"" language, and I live in the US. The issue is that I speak a different language at home on a day-to-day basis.

Sure, all the media I consume is in English and I text friends in English, but I rarely ever get the chance to speak it. Throughout the quarter, I only spoke English during group project meetings, and occasional group Zoom calls with friends. Which isn't too substantial, to be honest.

The last time I was constantly speaking English was back in September, during my summer job. Recently, I was in a 1-on-1 conversation with a friend (not a group setting, so I actually have to talk), and I realized my English skills have really atrophied since September. I know what I want to say, but the correct words just don't come to my mind. Has anybody experienced this? Any tips on how to cope?

My current method is to intentionally spend time everyday talking to myself about random topics in English, so I can improve bit by bit. But I am also looking for other ways.

Initially, I was going to continue with the 60 series. However, I would then need to take a regular quarter in the summer, since both Math 63CM and Physics 65 are only offered in the summer. Skipping ahead would also give more time for physics electives in the future.

If I take Physics 120 instead, I can take it during the spring, along with a Think course, CS 107, possibly mandarin, and whatever else looks interesting. Then, I could have my flex quarter in the summer, taking the math class and hopefully doing physics research.

I've taken AP Physics C in high school, both mechanics and E&amp;M, and have had exposure to some introductory quantum mechanics. I don't know vector calculus or differential equations super well, but I've learned a bit and feel that I can self-study the topics over break and during the course.

My physics professor doesn't recommend doing this, since you should have learned the math before going into this, as well as the PDE course pre/coreq (which I don't plan on taking because unit count, currently planning to take 18). She also says that the 60 series gives a strong foundation, but I feel that my foundation is already pretty solid physics-wise at least, and I feel up for the challenge of skipping ahead.

Ever since I was young I was very interested in science, particularly physics and I've always intended on pursuing it in the future. My parents were happy about it because they see STEM has being the ""safe"" way for a job, especially my dad who is a scientist. But for the past 5 years or so I've been starting to have different thoughts as I experienced new things. I'm much more excited and intrigued about political science and history now. In my last 2 years of high school I was thinking that I'm not that interested or good at math, and now after almost being done with my first quarter at Stanford this thought is very much solidified. I really don't like my math and CS class right now (purely for the subject, the professors are great)- only my political science classes right now are giving me any happiness.

I guess I'm a bit nervous about switching from pursuing STEM to humanities, partially because I'm worried about career prospects and I'm worried about my parents disapproving. And also it feels weird to finally admit that I care about humanities more because whenever I had that thought I always tried to convince myself that I wanted to do STEM.

And I'm also feeling a bit regretful because now I've kind of fucked my GPA because I think I'm only going to be able to manage to get a B/B+ in my calculus and CS class.

Their preference, however, would be for me to take a LoA for the rest of frosh year and take community college courses so that I can come in with sophomore standing (thus reducing how much they have to pay). Is this even possible?

TLDR; a couple of Stanford alums and I wanted to help students save their favorite memories especially at a time like this so we made an absolutely, completely, no bull-sh\*ttingly free one-line-a-day journal just for that.

I'm super lazy and have tried to journal multiple times. Bullet journals, one entry at night, one entry at day, etc, etc. Tried everything. At the beginning of quarantine, all of our days were beginning to mush together and I was losing track of what specific day of the week it was. It was just pset after pset and I literally was keeping track of my days by what number pset for CS 161 I was on. And then my friend hit me up about his one line journal idea and that's how we got started working on our journal!

Inspired by my friend's approach to his four years here, we made something that let's you save one ""gold nugget"", or one favorite memory, from your day to our app. We tried to make it as effortless and easy as possible so even the laziest and most forgetful people like myself still log one line a day. It's really just as simple as that.

No, it doesn't have ads. Nor does it have some kind of premium service (idk we haven't really thought about how to make money off of this). This has been our pure product of labor for the past few months and we just wanted to help Stanford students save their best memories in a place where you can go back and reminisce all about how you and your friends accidentally ran a stop sign and got pulled over by campus police or that time you went to your first screw-your-roo. We really want Stanford students to savor their experience even if it isn't on campus. With the quarter system being so brutal and Stanford's constant go go go mentality, it's super easy to just let the four years rush on by without stopping to remember all of your moments. So, we hope this can help with that. 

It would mean the world to us if you downloaded it from whatever platform you're on and gave us feedback! Absolutely roast us on the review if you thought it sucked or praise it and give it five stars! And if you want to read more about our thought process into how we made it, you can read more here  [https://medium.com/@alecq.deng/how-we-throw-away-our-own-happiness-96628f10650b](https://medium.com/@alecq.deng/how-we-throw-away-our-own-happiness-96628f10650b).

Thanks for reading this. I am in the application process for the Stanford LEAD online business program.

I live in Canada. The program is fully online.

 I'm facing a few funding issues. 

1- my employer will not pay/help to pay for it
2- Stanford does not provide any financial assistance for that program
3- since this is a part-time program, I do not qualify for any federal/provincial financial assistance in Canada
4- this program is not tax deductible in Canada (Even with a donation receipt)
5- I cannot use my RRSP without being penalized (30% tax) since this is part time. 
6- we're expecting our second child in December so taking $19K out of the emergency fund os not a suitable option.

So, I am a frosh currently taking Math 61CM. I absolutely love math and it is one of the prospective majors for me. The math 61CM class is SUCH a grind but I've found a really awesome community of friends in the class and I thoroughly enjoy the beauty of the problems and working on the PSETs. Its a loooot of time effort - I'd say at least 3-4 hours a day just understanding the material, plus 10-15 hours working on the weekly PSETS. However, for the course, I honestly don't mind. 

But I just got got the grades back from the first midterm and my score is in the bottom 25% of the class. I'm getting decent scores (few points off) on the psets. I would just suck it up and work even harder for the class but I can safely say I'm at my workload limit - I'm taking 20 units (13 of which are all prereqs for prospective majors, and a CS class that honestly is pretty chill, plus a couple of 1 units). 

Besides being on the bottom 25%, the top 25% of the class got a score of 97.5%+. Im trying to understand how the class is curved, and assuming I continue scoring like this, how likely is it I pass the course?

Because I'm honestly willing to switch to credit/no credit and slog through bc of how much I love the class, I just can't afford to not receive credit for the course.

I also don't have any linear algebra background, but I'd consider myself generally strong in math in a non-stanfordian perspective. So ideally, if I were to drop the course I could switch into math 51 + 56, but as a frosh I'm not allowed to take more units and the drop deadline for my other courses has passed, so I can't use math 56 as a Segway to proof based mathematics this quarter either.

Anyway, any advice from people who might have gone through something similar before, whether in math or another discipline? Also any advice on how courses tend to be curved and where I might stack up as well might be helpful.

&gt;Furr wrote that students living in on-campus residences will be allowed to form “households” or “social pods,” comprising no more than eight students, within housing facilities. Social pods will be required to register with Stanford to “facilitate contact tracing.” Those living in social pods will be able to interact with each other “as would members of a household”— effectively allowing students to interact with up to eight community members without social distancing or having to wear masks, provided they are distanced from other pods. 

OCH email yesterday:

&gt;Just as an FYI, further clarification on the new guidelines for how to make and register “households” of 8 people will be released early next week, so please keep your eyes peeled for that important information. 

It is a good thing that the University has taken student concerns about mental health an the overall strictness of the compact seriously. But I don't think officially registering a ""pod"" makes very much sense. Friendships and romantic relationships can change unpredictably. Forcing people to pre-register these creates some of the same problems associated with the original draconian version of the rules, and it puts people in a very uncomfortable position of having to rank their personal relationships and negotiate with others.

It's also, simultaneously, a bit too permissive. With the caveat that the full set of rules haven't been published yet, 8 people is a lot and if these pods cut across actual households (people who live together) you can end up ""linking"" a *lot* of people. Just a probably-not-typical example to prove a point: Say you have a bunch of households of *m* people, each person in each household is a member of a different pod. Worst case:

1. You're directly exposed to up to 6 + m people
2. You're two degrees away from up to another 14(m-1) people
3. You're three degrees away from 49(m-1)+ 6m\^2. 

For m &gt; 2, this is pretty bad. My point here isn't that it increases a lot in *degrees* (this is always the case) but it increases rapidly in *m*. This can be mitigated by limiting the number of unique pods per real household, but that makes the negotiation problem so much worse. Not only do I have to rank my friends, but I have to take my roommates and my friends' roommates priorities into account? Maybe if we give Paul Milgrom a few years and a juicy research grant he can solve this problem. (Also note that more restrictions on pods --&gt; more people seeing eachother against the rules --&gt; more cross-household linkage.)

A better alternative would be something like: You can visit *n* number of people outside your household a week, or between negative tests.\* Outdoor 6-foot interaction with masks would not count. And even for indoor interaction that counts, the rule should be **wear masks unless you're doing something which prevents it**. Putting a piece of cloth on your face is such a small ask compared to everything else.

You could of course debate what *n* should be, whether Stanford and non-Stanford people should count the same way, and it would of course be hard to enforce. But I submit that pretty much any problem with this system is also going to occur with the pods. The proposed alternative could be implemented as a ""pod"" system where you can update your pod every week. That sounds more complicated but I would argue it's actually a lot easier, because the stakes are just who you see that week.

0.0,1599594040.0,88.0,stanford,"Some advice for incoming frosh:

Coursework: Don't drown yourself in classes. Every year, many frosh end up overcommitting academically in fall quarter, despite advice from upperclassmen and [academic advisors](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/academic-planning/cardinal-compass/your-questions-answered/how-do-i-decide-how-many-classes-take). Most people will tell you that the best part about Stanford is the people, and it's true. It's difficult to make the most of the Stanford community when you're bogged down with homework and deadlines. Take the time to meet as many people as possible, even if it's virtually!

Introsems: Take them! A great way to interact with professors and your peers in a more intimate setting. [introsems.stanford.edu](https://introsems.stanford.edu)

Academic Progress: You're not in a race with your peers. Don't stress if you feel that others are ahead of you in a course sequence, have coded since high-school or have written 10,000-word research papers. Everyone completes their degree at a different pace, so take your time and take advantage of Stanford's many [tutoring and advising resources](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/tutoring-support/tutoring). Do yourself a favor and go through Stanford at your own pace – more on this below.

Class Engagement: As many of you will know from high school, it can be easy to get by in some classes without really engaging with the material or learning much from the course. This is also the case for some courses at Stanford. Stanford has world-renowned professors and incredible courses, so make the most of them. The more you put into your classes, the more you'll get out. If you're taking lots of heavy classes in one quarter, you'll quickly find that it can be difficult to stay fully engaged with each course.

Course Selection: [Fast Courses](https://fastcourses.org) is a faster way to browse through courses than Carta. Spend some time before the quarter starts exploring courses on ExploreCourses and FastCourses – more often than not, you'll discover a course that you didn't know existed. Browsing through hundreds of courses can be a tedious task, but use the filters to narrow down your search. Also, it's always a great idea to ask your friends what they're taking!

Office Hours: Office hours are revered by Stanford students. Show up with any number of difficult questions from your homework, and your professor or TA will usually point you in the right direction. Most core classes have bustling office hour sessions, but don't worry if you're the only one who attends these sessions for your class. If you need help with coursework, or you just want to get to know your professor, office hours are a great place to start.

Syllabi: Check out the syllabus for your class to get an idea of workload and course structure – some professors are better than others at posting these before classes start. Find them here: [https://syllabus.stanford.edu/syllabus/](https://syllabus.stanford.edu/syllabus/)

Extracurriculars/Student Organizations: Student organizations are a great way to meet people with similar interests and are a cornerstone of many students' undergraduate experience. Attend the virtual activities fair and learn more about Stanford's many student organizations. Like classes, don't overcommit yourself and take time to explore organizations that interest you. Feel free to drop a club commitment if it's too much and also know that some student organizations welcome students joining at any time of the year. Here is a [list of clubs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17eCKvaDIgKk6ZzhduXqET0a2YZFyK6Z9acRgxzA_DOk/edit) compiled by Stanford.

Language Requirement: Review the language requirement and think about when you want to start your language course sequence. You can fulfil the requirement anytime during your undergraduate career, but some students prefer completing the language course sequence early on. [https://language.stanford.edu/academics/language-requirement](https://language.stanford.edu/academics/language-requirement)

Majors/Minors: Four years is more than enough time to be successful in your major and maybe even pick up a minor or two along the way. Note that if you're considering a double major, you'll have a little less flexibility with your course selection and more planning is needed earlier on. Having said that, most Stanford undergraduates end up with one major. As mentioned above, if you need to space out difficult major classes over a couple of quarters rather than doing 2-3 core courses in one quarter, give yourself that space. Again, it's not a race.

Four Year Plans: I won't say too much about these other than that they can be useful for some students as a reference point but are likely to change as new courses are offered each year. If you're curious about your progress towards a certain major, read the undergraduate handbook for your major department (can be found on department website) and speak with your academic advisor.

Thinking Matters and PWR 1: Both of these are requirements for frosh. Certain programs (ESF) fulfil these requirements. Sophomores have PWR 2! Learn more about Thinking Matters [here](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/thinking-matters) and PWR 1 [here](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-1/pwr-1-assignment-sequence). A quick note about Think, ESF, and PWR courses: some courses are considerably more demanding than others despite being the same number of units, so reading Carta reviews can be useful!

WAYS Requirements: If you have extra space in your schedule, consider taking a class that fulfils a certain WAYS requirement. Don't worry too much about this during frosh year, but it can be useful to know what the requirements are and where they'll roughly fit into your undergraduate career. [https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways/about-ways](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways/about-ways)

Final Note: Take courses you enjoy, do things you love, and be true to yourself. You got into Stanford for a reason, and remember, that reason is different from everyone else's. Some weeks will be harder than others, some quarters might not go to plan, but keep at it with an open mind and a willingness to work hard, and you'll thrive here at Stanford.

Had a very non traditional route -&gt;govt-&gt;specialized consulting 

not stanford affiliated in anyway but wanted to apply to the ms there. if not this year in the future. I want to work for a company where tech is the core of my day to day activity instead of in finance/insurance like I am right now as a consultant. I generally like programming and stats and am thinking of taking an NDO to prepare for t hat.

1) out of curiosity what are the highest acceptance rates from what people have heard for stanford masters? I imagine there aint much difference but i thought i'd ask in case there may be some programs that might have a reasonable acceptance rate and are reachable. My interests include economics, finance, near eastern languages, and cs.

2) if I don't have research experience (did premed research for a year in undergrad and had a capstone for another masters I did). Work in NYC. How can I possibly get a remote research position at Stanford? A lot of the CS specialities aren’t really strong here in the NYC area. I am not a student currently and have been working, which seems atypical for research positions.

3) Taking NDO courses seems to be risky, as there isn’t much pay off or guarantee as far as Masters admissions. Took Calc in a T10 undergrad. Haven’t really taken done linear algebra which is a requirement for the MSEng. Should I jump into Math52? It’s difficult because you can go two or three elvels  into preqrequisites based on stanfords class listing requirement. The Stanford counselors don’t seem helpful in this regard in helping you choose courses and just refer you to the ‘pre-requisites’ which for programs like MSCS aren’t clear.

So if you can see my dilemma: on one hand Math52 is a pre-req to a program I’m interested in and yet I like other courses such as those that can help me in interviewing (data structures algorithms 106A

) or jobs (ie networking). So which NDO courses should I take pre-reqs or something just to prove my chops? Should I take one or two just to get a good grade and prove I have the chops?

I'm an incoming international Frosh and I plan to major in CS. During high school, I was enrolled in my country's own board so I don't really have AP credits. When I checked the CS course requirements in explore degrees, it's stated there that I need to either take Math 19, 20, and 21 or waive that requirement with AP credits.

However, do I really need to take Math 19 and 20 as well? Cause that kinda feels basic and a lot of other STEM majors that I'm interested in as well require the 51 sequence only, so in that sense, CS seems to be a black sheep in the engineering department.

I am literally so conflicted as to what I should be majoring in because quite honestly, there are way too many things that I am interested in at Stanford.

My original plan was to double major (CS + Mechanical Engineering or CS + Econ) with CS being the primary major as I heard that CS is one of the most valuable degrees that you can get at Stanford. However, I heard today that CS and MechE have a lot of courses in common that you can't count twice for both majors.

I thought about CS + Econ as well (with Econ first as a minor), but somebody told me that the Econ major is literally the Econ minor + some more electives. I thought about doing that, but I heard the CS major is pretty intensive in units and I'm worried I wouldn't be able to satisfy my WAYS requirements if I did this.

Also a note about coterms: I'm definitely hoping to do one - I was planning originally to do a CS Major and either Econ/MechE double major, and then do MS&amp;E as my coterm major. However, I was told that it might be a better idea to do MechE or Econ major and then coterm in CS... what should I do?

If it helps, I definitely hope to go into either tech entrepreneurship and eventually finance (Investment Banking, Venture Capital, or consulting). I helped launch a startup this summer, which made me realize the value of an education in CS and MechE. However, is an econ degree really necessary to work in finance?

0.0,1598581657.0,36.0,stanford,"Hey everyone, so I'm an incoming frosh who has literally zero idea of what college is going to be like, much less what college at Stanford is like. I hear so many great things about the Frosh year at Stanford. And being someone who comes from a high school of 70 kids, with a senior class of 18, in a town without much to do,  I never really had much experience even being a teenager or doing teenager things like simply going out with friends. My friends were all from school but none of us were especially close and we were all pretty focused on school + extracurriculars + getting into good colleges.

I was lucky enough to be granted on-campus housing so I'll be able to live there with other students, but in my gut it still all just feels like a let down because of the virus. This was going to be the first time in my life I would even have the opportunity to have any semblance of ""fun"" or close-nit friendships.

People tell me that I should be grateful that I'm going to *\~\~Stanford\~\~*, or that it's going to be great any way because it's *\~\~Stanford\~\~*, or that at the end of the day I only have good decisions to make (on whether to gap or not) because it's *\~\~Stanford\~\~*, but it just doesn't feel that way to me.

I wanted to have a Frosh dorm experience, I wanted to be one of the people in those pictures on the Stanford website where they're all standing arms together, I wanted to be able to form connections with people, I wanted some amount of adventure after years of feeling burnt out from the tedium of driving to school, doing work, driving to extra curriculars, and driving home. I fear that after years of waiting for college to come, the rug has been swept out from under me.

**So, I guess what I want is to know exactly how much less-off this year is going to be for someone who is on-campus.** I want to be validated that ""yes"", this coming year is going to be worse because of the pandemic.

**Update** Someone dmed me this:

it's ironic because i know the guy and he knows absolutely nothing about programming. He wrote his first line of code less than a year ago in an intro class and he usually never knew what to do. It was interesting to watch this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VSJSONhr90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VSJSONhr90) because it appears that he's trying to build a spurious reputation for himself as an experienced CS programmer when he really isn't. He also falsely claims he's ""built many other web apps and apps"" which is weird if your first language was python that you learned some months ago. From what I know he followed along some PHP Developer course on Coursera or Udemy. The other weird thing is that he seems to be paraphrasing zuckerberg, sometimes verbatim, like ""expanding to 100+ schools"". The fact that he used archaic tech like PHP/SQL exemplifies this since anyone with any experience would know this tech is outdated. Even if you used these tools you have to be very careful about guarding against exploits, most of which are well documented since PHP and SQL are so old. He also bragged about the security of the site in the previous article and on an IG page, which caustically came back to bite him because it probably prompted the hacker to begin with.",Does Link have a security vulnerability that exposed our data?,t3_ihigjr,11.0,1.0

Do you expect to hit it big in the Bay Area in the five years after graduation?

You can live indefinitely off 4% of your savings and be forever financially independent (until you start having kids, and then your expenses are more than 4%). But this is basically impossible if you take 200K in loans with interest, unless you hit it big, which is very unlikely. **Are the opportunities for an** ***undergrad*** **and the faculty/mentoring and other students so great that it would be it to go here instead of Macaulay Honors CUNY, which is free?**",How do you afford this school?,t3_ig37w1,0.0,0.34

2. If I need general things from a store (socks, toothpaste, soap, drinks) is there a place within the campus to go to, or is something like this only obtainable from an outside location?

3. Is the public transportation really convenient and safe to get around Hyde Park and around the city? My mom is worried about this and wants me to take my car to make it easier on myself.

And I get it, as a first year, you are, to some extent, navigating uni/college blindly and can only learn through experience. But a recent voice message with them crying recently has pretty much spiked my concern. I’m a senior in a different university, so I constantly give them advice; I think it is very difficult for them to wrap their head around the tips I give them which may or may not make it easier to get through reading-heavy courses. And since I didn’t go through the Uchicago experience, this may also make it difficult to apply these tips.

If any sophomores - seniors have advice, tips, tricks, helpful experiences, know any resources etc for how to get through the reading-heavy required/core courses like Soc and Global Studies, I would really appreciate it.

As we all know crime has been on the rise in Hyde Park and particularly around Woodlawn with almost daily incidents of muggings, robberies, and assaults meaning that when we leave dorm to smoke at the end of a day of classes we are putting ourselves in a not insignificant bit of danger. 

 My reasoning is this: why not set up a chat group (Snapchat, Insta, Messenger, or whatever) to try and coordinate our exits so that we can go in SMALL groups rather than alone?  I am not suggesting we break social distancing guidelines but IMHO going in pairs or threes would feel significantly safer (not to mention possibly more enjoyable rather than going alone) and the risk is minimized by the fact that we all take COVID tests weekly anyways because we are all on university housing.

If this really is the case, that is if the sequence is so widely frowned upon by undergrad and grad students alike, why hasn’t the department done anything about it? They seemed to have no problem with ditching PHYS 154 (Modern Physics) last year after realizing its utter worthlessness. Any thoughts on the consensus surrounding the 211s?

They were both trying to argue their points on what school was superior, but it just felt weird hearing them argue over it. The weeks leading up to applying, I constantly browsed both this reddit and r/Northwestern and found the people here to be more like those I would be friends with. I could see myself engaged in discussions about Plato's Allegory of the Cave  until 3:00 am. I can't see myself going to a football game on a Friday night and then going to a frat party afterwards.

As I was drafting my why UChicago essay, I lurked on this subreddit for weeks. Many of the common UChicago traditions/activities mentioned here were sooooo helpful since I couldn't visit the campus campus and it had been some time since my mom attended. Unbeknownst to most of the people posting here, I was diligently taking notes carefully crafting my ""why"" essay.

Literally no other school requires this amount of specificity in their application process.

**New Note:** For the week of Thanksgiving, UChicago opted not to test from 4pm on Wednesday through Sunday. They will also no longer be holding make-up testing on Sundays. More information available here: [https://goforward.uchicago.edu/covid-testing/testing-holiday-schedule/](https://goforward.uchicago.edu/covid-testing/testing-holiday-schedule/)

**\^Note:** The Total Cases &amp; Contact Tracing weekly data is actually tallied from in a time-window two days offset from the University Testing Program data (11/20-11/26).

**\*Note:** The positive tests indicated in the **Total Cases** and the **University Testing program** sections may differ. This is not only because of the reasoning in the previous note, but also because the **Total Cases** section counts both positive results from the University testing program as well as ""cases identified among members of the University community who sought testing"" per the UChicago go forward website.

**\*\*Note:** The % Change between weeks for positivity rate is calculated by subtracting the current week from the previous week, which is different from the calculation for total tests and positive tests

I'll admit that I'm kind of shy, but I've never really had any trouble making friends in the past. I had a strong, consistent group of friends in high school that I (optimistically maybe lol) feel will be my friends for life. I know friendships don't happen overnight, but I really want to make connections with people here.

I came without any real connections made prior. No one from my high school is here and I feel like maybe it's too late to randomly reach out on instagram etc. I didn't get super close to to the people in my hallway and sometimes I feel like I'm annoying the few people I do know, which just exacerbates my anxiety. I joined clubs this quarter and occasionally grab lunch with a friend, but don't feel that I really have anyone that I can consistently rely on. At this point it looks like people have made their friend groups, and I'm not sure with online classes/clubs how I can break into any of them or form my own. I definitely don't want to spend the rest of university sad and lonely, but I'm not sure where to go from here.

I’m currently in the process of self-studying the Spivak Calculus book, and have come to this wonderful sub for help. UChicago is one of the schools I’m aware of that has used Spivak regularly and historically for their honors calculus sequence, so it seemed natural to come here for guidance on how to structure my self study plan.
I’m currently on a leave of absence, with no teachers available to me, no constant internet access. All I have is Spivak and some scrap paper on which I can transfer notes from the internet by hand. Currently, I’m reading the chapter content and trying to go through every single problem in the book and it is incredibly time consuming. I understand this is a rigorous treatment of calculus, and “proper” maths takes time to learn, but surely you guys didn’t have time in your academic quarters to go through every problem in the book in addition to your other classes? For those of you who have gone through math 161,162,163 and I presume Spivak’s Calculus in its entirety, is trying to solve every problem necessary for someone with the goal of next learning Baby Rudin, Algebra, and higher level courses? Is it something students of the course naturally have to do through homework and lectures or do most students just select a handful from each chapter to go through?

I do wish to skip around some problems in order to get through the material quicker (at least quicker than I am right now), but the nature of Spivaks book seems to be of such that problems are interconnected, and at least within chapters, the key to solving one problem is in some problems prior, which I may have skipped. I guess I’m really looking for a good selection of problems that won’t sacrifice my understanding of the material, if that is advisable anyways. Any additional tips and know-how in getting through this book would also be greatly appreciated! 

Thank you for your time if you’ve actually made it this far.

0.0,1604978651.0,50.0,uchicago,"Hello,

I am a 2014 college grad. During undergrad, I studied abroad with UChicago for a Chinese program and was at the receiving end of bullying comments and behavior by one of the instructors. I know this is nearly a decade later, but for a long time I never wanted to admit to myself that an instructor would behave this way toward students, that it had affected me so much, or that I was too timid to stand up for myself. This is a draft of an email I was going to send to the Dean of Students. Should I bother? I removed certain details to try to keep the instructor as anonymous as possible for the purposes of this post. Thank you!



EDIT: I submitted my grievance, and here is the final draft I sent, with identifying details removed.
""Dear Office of the Dean of Students:
I am a 2014 college graduate and studied abroad with the university in [quarter], [year], in [location] for the [program]. I understand that this is an extremely late grievance and I don't expect anything to come out of it, but this instructor's behavior was too outrageous and made for too hostile an environment and I wanted to leave a written record of my complaint. For the longest time, I didn't want to admit to myself that I was too timid to stand up for myself, or that this had affected me so deeply, or that an instructor - someone whom I'd trusted - would engage in such degrading behavior toward students.

The instructor whom I'm mentioning has made inappropriate remarks involving students' appearances, including repeatedly remarking that a male student was handsome, and on one occasion, explicitly stating that a female student was not good looking enough.

On one occasion, the instructor was handing out tickets for students to see a performance and did not hand one to me. When I inquired why, he explicitly stated that it's ""because I don't like you."" (因为我不喜欢你). 

He has made his disdain for me even more apparent on other occasions as well. Against my better judgment, I confided in him that my father used excessive corporal punishment against me when I was a child. For one of our assignments, we were to watch a movie in the Chinese language and write about it. I am a heritage speaker of Chinese, but do not have the language fully mastered. I asked the instructor whether it would be okay for us to watch ""you xi ji"" (游戏机） for the assignment. My intention was to ask whether it was okay to watch a classic Chinese series referred to as ""xi you ji."" （西游记）. However, I mistakenly switched ""xi"" and ""you."" When I mistakenly switched those two words, I mistakenly said ""video game"" instead of ""classic."" To my surprise, the instructor then responded by saying, ""No wonder your dad beat you."" (难怪你爸爸打你.) In my confusion, I asked why wanting to watch a classic instead of a regular movie would result in my dad beating me, and then he told me I switched the words around. In response, I told him I accidentally said it wrong, to which he instructed me, ""then don't say it wrong."" (那就不要说错). I was truly shocked and hurt by his words - first and foremost, I also work as a language instructor now, and the only way students learn is through making mistakes, and that secondly, he would take this innocent mistake and then imply that I deserved to be beat for it.

There are other examples in which his behavior made me truly uncomfortable and his palpable disdain for me, which he vocalized on numerous occasions, caused me great anxiety and stress, such as instances in which he criticized my lifestyle choices or told me that his impression of me was that I was a lazy student, but I will leave it at this. All quotations here are the English translations of the original Chinese, to the best of my memory. I have also included the Chinese quotations, in case anyone wishes to verify the accuracy of my translations. While the instructor certainly has the right to dislike me all he wants, he does not have the right to engage in discriminatory behavior, and I believe he has crossed the line of what is acceptable.

Again, I understand that this inquiry is coming in extremely late, and while I don't expect much to come out of it, I wish for an administrator to acknowledge my grievance and leave a written record of my grievance. I also understand that this also carries the risk of retaliation by that instructor, but I write this message in complete good faith and am willing to stake my personal and professional reputation on the veracity of my complaint. 

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

2. Free time is important and really underrated by the university. Hip Hop was invented because people were bored and wanted to build sound systems and play with records.  Einstein's first papers were written during free time, etc.

3. Why do you care about taking classes? It might feel like you're not spending your money right, but if you end up suffering more in each class when you take classes is it really worth it??

**\^Note:** The Total Cases &amp; Contact Tracing weekly data is actually tallied from in a time-window two days offset from the University Testing Program data (10/2-10/8).

**\*Note:** The positive tests indicated in the **Total Cases** and the **University Testing program** sections may differ. This is not only because of the reasoning in the previous note, but also because the **Total Cases** section counts both positive results from the University testing program as well as ""cases identified among members of the University community who sought testing"" per the UChicago go forward website.

**\*\*Note:** The % Change between weeks for positivity rate is calculated by subtracting the current week from the previous week, which is different from the calculation for total tests and positive tests.

That doesn't mean everything has nothing to do with UChicago. Stuff like

- mental health services
- intense quarter system
- complaints about Chicago's dating scene
- memes like ""that kid"" (which isn't really a UChicago thing but it has become a campus culture thing)

are all relevant for this sub. But seriously, some random TED talk you found or ""omg quirky XD"" shitposts are not.

This could be a fairly controversial post. I want to begin by saying that I completely empathise with all of you about having such a watered-down first year, both socially and academically. Your first year in college is supposed to be a time to reinvent yourself, find or advance your passions, meet lifelong friends, and grow to become more mature and independent. Many of these things will be hindered significantly by the challenges posed by COVID-19. I was lucky to have a normal first year, and I am incredibly grateful for it. It's a shame you all won't be able to experience the same right now.

That being said, the desire for a normal year should not blind us from the very real threat the coronavirus poses. Over the last few days, lots of people have seen tons of first-years (and some upperclassmen) congregating in big groups, in close quarters, when many of you all are supposed to be quarantining. As someone who is friends with RAs in on-campus housing, I have heard that there have been serious problems with first-years sneaking out of their 10-day quarantines (which are less strictly enforced than the 14-day ones) to gather socially. As you can imagine, management is far from happy with the current social climate, and there have been talks among RHs about the need to shut housing down this early.

Presumably, many of you came to campus for a reason: to get some semblance of a normal college year. But there are others of us who came to campus out of necessity. Some don't have stable internet connections at home. Others don't have a home environment that is conducive to work, or have unhealthy familial relationships. There are also people who can't go back to their families due to travel restrictions. By neglecting basic social distancing measures and touting necessary precautions, you are not just putting yourself and your college experience this year at risk; you are risking the academic potential and mental health of many of your peers and upperclassmen who are doing everything right because they HAVE to.

The fallout from campus closing down has far greater scope than on just the students. If an outbreak on campus does occur and students are sent home, we would be seeding every city in America and many across the world with new coronavirus cases that each have the potential to cause a local resurgence of the virus. Members of this community could be sent home the minute dorms are forced to close. Thus, we have not only a responsibility for the health of our peers and professors, but a responsibility to the world to be safe.

This post isn't calling for all of you to lock yourselves in your rooms and not talk to anyone for the rest of the quarter; that would defeat the purpose of many of you coming here in the first place. But I ask all of you, for the sake of our less privileged peers, to be more aware of the steps we can take to minimise the spread of the virus. Fulfil your quarantine instructions to the best of your ability. When meeting your peers, stay distanced from them and wear masks, even if you are outside. Don't stay in proximity of too many people for too long. Avoid large groups. These are all simple, fairly non-restrictive steps all of us can take.

I plead with you to read and think about this with an open mind. The impact of your actions could not only have an impact on you, but your peers, professors, families, and communities. Thank you.",Dear First-Years...,t3_iz4o6p,147.0,0.94

unless there are a whole lot of people who wanna participate, which i doubt, there will be no auditions (duh) and you’ll become a part of the band where everyone *definitely* knows how to play music right away!

requirements:

1. you don’t have to have some pro skill in the instrument that you’re playing, but we appreciate enthusiasm and passion for playing music!

2. it’d be nice if you were from class of 2024 as it’ll be sad if you graduate earlier than everyone else and we become a sad band that is never gonna be the same without their other member :(

3. we’ll play something along the lines of rock/alternative/indie music and probably start with covers of cool songs, so genre matching is quite essential (but most of the time we’re just gonna jam in our free time, so don’t feel like you need to skip out if you’re more into jazz or hardcore)

4. maybe kinda don’t come in with very high expectations??? we don’t really know what we’re doing yet (or ever) and whether Logan is even gonna open for rehearsals, so this is more for fucking around to get through the existential dread of the place where fun goes to die

I have been using Linux all through high school and have gotten pretty used to using it (Mint in particular). Halfway through high school the wifi my school used began requiring some portal that did not work on Linux very well so my work around was simply to always be logged in as a guest. I guess my question is can I get away with never using Windows or Mac OS on campus? Are there required programs for the Physics department or some file sharing program for projects etc. etc. where Linux would be a problem?

I'm currently brainstorming some potential program offerings for 2nd years and would really like to hear some thoughts on the sort of topics, program structure, and any other general ideas that 2nd years would like to see more of!

Some ideas I currently have:

\- more volunteer opportunities that encompass different fields/industries with potential grants/stipends given out at the end/after a certain number of hours (because we all know that second year resumes might not be as built out as 3rd/4th years due to lack of experience,etc.)

\- potential collaborations with professors to source more research opportunities to second years (who again might have problems due to lack of experience)

\- more field/major explorations programs such as more shadowing opportunities, or more meetings with alumni or upperclassmen in the field/major

Some other ideas: 

 \- Maybe collaborations between different RSO’s on campus and non-profit organizations so that even ordinary club members can get some experience. I.e. such as the gardening club (UChicago horticulture club) with local parks to do a greenery initiative? This will really reward students who are active in an RSO and encourage students to participate in more extracurricular activities. 

\- More programs/initiatives that help students start their own startups and non-profits – whether by introducing them to alumni who have done this, providing funding for startups and starting a non-profit, or teaching students about how they can go about doing this.

—

The political culture here is toxic beyond what I could have possibly expected. It’s not just pro-Biden, it’s anti-Trump—to the point that all Trump supporters are despicable human beings who are undeserving of respect and who should promptly be cancelled.

Recently, this guy in the Class of 2024 group chat basically asked if there were any fellow Trump supporters in the group, or if he is alone.^[1]

Shortly after, several people acknowledged the guy’s perfectly legitimate question as ‘bait’ because... “no way someone can be so delusional as to support Trump, right?”^[2]

When it became apparent that it was not in fact ‘bait’, some of the group’s radical leftists rose to the occasion to make it clear that if you support Trump, you are unworthy of their respect and that because you support a “terrible person”, you too are a “terrible person”.^[3] ^[4] ^[5]

This university proudly portrays itself as an environment of free speech, where people are encouraged to share their ideas and discuss them, no matter how much their ideologies differ from one another. Clearly this isn’t the case when it comes to politics.

Are people no longer entitled to their own political views? Is the political culture so toxic here that one is automatically assumed to have bad character if they support Trump?

I am interested in enrolling in UChicago's law school's 'Public Law and Legal Theory' workshop. I will begin my Master's this Fall and hope to use the Master's degree as a springboard to a doctoral program in Anthropology focused on socio-cultural theory and legal theory.

When I learned about the Public Law and Legal Theory Workshop, I was very excited because of the exposure and engagement it provides students to legal theory. I believe the workshop might help to strengthen my legal competency and investigation into legal regimes and help me become a more competitive applicant.

I wanted to learn about other people's experiences regarding the workshop. 

1. What was the workload like? Light, heavy, medium? Was it easy to balance with the rest of your courses?
2. Was it difficult to pass the workshop (it is pass/fail)? 
3. Did you enjoy the workshop? Why or why not? 
4. What were the discussions like between students and faculty?

Yesterday afternoon, a friend of mine parked on 53rd St. near Greenwood Ave. and later found that someone had struck her car while she was away. A witness reported the license plate number of the driver who hit her to the police and they tracked down the driver, who admitted to causing the accident and leaving the scene.

While the investigation happened, I stopped into a nearby shop that had security cameras pointed at that intersection. The owner let me watch the footage, which definitely shows the accident, though it's small and hard to make out precise details. That said, the footage clearly shows a cyclist riding between the parked cars along the curb, and the van that struck my friend's car. It also appears to show the cyclist getting smashed by the van in the accident. It's unclear whether the cyclist was actually struck - or, if they were, whether they were injured. There was no blood near the scene of the accident, and it appears they took off immediately after the collision.

The shop owner told me that the security cameras tape over themselves every day, but he let me record the playback of the footage on my phone. I showed the footage to the officers who were conducting the investigation, but they seemed uninterested in it. My friend called the non-emergency line today and offered to share the video and they declined.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **MATH 16100 (Honors Calculus IBL)**
2. **PHYS 14100 (Honors Mechanics)**
3. **HUMA 11500 (Philosophical Perspectives)**
4. SOSC 11400 (Power, Identity, Resistance)

Since I have done well in AP Physics C and the proof-based mathematical courses I have taken, I think I am well-prepared to enter the math and physics class.   Additionally, I have a solid background in composing essays (and reading through dense texts), so I am somewhat familiar with the standards of HUMA and SOSC.  I am not concerned about the content difficulty of these courses *per se*, but the time commitments involved in these courses. Is it impossible for me to lead a relatively normal life while succeeding in these courses, or are reports of their ""notoriety"" exaggerated?   I am genuinely interested in all of the above courses, and I would relish the experience of taking them.  Nonetheless, I am as concerned about my grades as I am about the ""life of the mind,"" and I would not want my grades to suffer by overwhelming myself.

If this schedule is impossibly intense, I could substitute the SOSC class for an ""easier"" one, or scrap SOSC altogether and take a CORE BIO class or a CIV class.   Any thoughts are appreciated!

Anyway, I'm a rising second year this year and pretty undecided about my major. I'm finishing all my Core classes pretty soon and obviously have to think about majors and such. However, I feel like I'm a bit of a crossroads because I came in wanting to be an English/Creative Writing major and I took World Lit for my HUM, which while I enjoyed, I didn't love it as much as I thought/hoped I would. I mean, the texts were definitely fun to read, but I found that the type of analysis that I was asked to do in class didn't appeal to me as much. On the other hand, I took Classics as my SOSC and absolutely loved it. The texts and reading were definitely less ""fun"" and a bit more dry, but found that I got a lot more out of them and the type of analysis that I was asked to do was a lot more interesting. Plus, I got to have some really interesting conversations about politics and government with my profs in office hours which was really cool. This difference could have been due to my profs and their different styles of teaching (even though I was really lucky to have really good profs for both HUM and SOSC all three quarters), but it definitely has me thinking more in the way of Political Science/Philosophy. 

At the moment, I'm pre-registered for an intro Political Science class and an intro English class just because I don't want to rule it out completely, but due to the really positive experience I had with Classics, I'm wondering what majors I should look into and the benefits/drawbacks to both the Political Science and Philosophy majors.

HUM core: PATH

MUSI 15100 Harmony and Voice Leading I

CMSC 16100 Honor intro CS I

I originally planned to take Western Civ because I kind of like the idea of cold calls and the topic itself, in addition to the course’s good reputation. However, IBL sounds so FUN and INTERESTING to me. I like the ideas that students prove things on their own and present their proofs in front of the class and interact with each other more often. But I also worried that two honors might be too much, especially the other being CS. If I choose not to do IBL, I will probably take MATH 15300 or 15910 in Spring, depending on my higher math placement.

If IBL is really that interesting as I imagine it would be, I won’t mind putting countless time in it. If it’s not IBL but the regular honor clac sequence would I rather take Western Civ.

In consideration of dropping off Western Civ, is IBL really worth it, and are honors CS+Calc IBL doable? I really appreciate if anyone in this sub could give me some advice on what I should do, thanks!

My main questions regarding this are

1. 131 seems to have significantly more class hours than 151, so is it also more comprehensive? Or is it very similar in difficulty to 151, just with more work?

2. If I want to major in Computer Science, will MATH 131 meet the prerequisite requirements I need for some classes?

3. How would I go about moving to 151 from 131? Can I do it now or do I have to wait until I'm actually on campus?

I was placed into math 153/161(+IBL)/183 with the option to take the higher-level exam.

If I take 153, then I still have to take 183 and 184, so there's no point to do that. Alternatively, instead of 183, I can take 163 and fulfill one of the math requirements for the astro major, but I would still have to take 184, 19620, 20250, or 23000 afterward (I can jump right into any of these, as I believe the 160s count as the prerequisites).

While Penn’s reporting system quickly provides an individual their risk of having COVID-19, it does not provide an individual their risk of catching COVID-19 from others.
Two common-sense solutions can help UPenn and the students prevent a campus outbreak: (1) daily updates of testing statistics and (2) more clear communication of policy. These will give students ample information and incentive to adjust their behaviors to reduce risks.

I am an independent student who is currently highly aided. In 2020 I received some money from inheritance (it’s not a lot at all) and I have to report it on my taxes this year as income. 

The money is not currently in my possession and I used some of it to buy a used car, the rest is in an account under my sister’s name so I can save it for my graduate degree. 

I don’t know what to do about my financial aid next year? My income will look very high, when in reality I do not even have most of the money left anymore. Because of this, I put the numbers into the EFC calculator and the price is more than I can afford, it is half of my total income for the year. 

I just don’t understand how they expect me to pay so much when the income I got is 
1. Not even a livable wage for a year and 
2. I am an independent student who supports myself, therefore I have spent a lot of the money already 

I’m honestly just looking for advice on what to do or who to reach out to to talk about this with. It’s only a one time thing so my income will only be increased on 1 tax return, but I cannot afford how much they want me to spend.

""A MESSAGE TO THE PENN COMMUNITY ABOUT COVID POSITIVITY RATES FROM: 
Wendell Pritchett, Provost
Craig Carnaroli, Executive Vice President
Benoit Dubé, Associate Provost and Chief Wellness Officer

The University is seeing worrisome trends in the positivity rate of COVID-19 in our undergraduate student population this week. This situation is concerning amidst the emergence of highly transmissible variants in nearby communities.

It is critical that students only gather with their pod while watching the Super Bowl or when doing any other activities. Do not gather with people outside of your pod. 

We have been sending students home for conduct not in line with the Student Campus Compact, and will continue to do so throughout the semester.

Remain vigilant—mask up, maintain a safe distance, wash your hands. Don’t be the weakest link; if trends don’t reverse, we will move into Campus Alert Level 3–a campus-wide Safer at Home order—imposing new restrictions as early as next week.

It just seems ironic, considering that no small portion of the people now silent were the ones most aggressively pestering kids in our class when the celebration screenshots came out. It seems that personal opinions are coloring the social/political positions being held, which, I guess when you think about it, isn't actually that surprising. Of course, for the people who are staying consistent to ""holding people accountable,"" good on you.

Now, I don't think there's any point in dragging this whole affair with the slideshow out longer. Was the powerpoint mean? Of course it was, and I hope those in it (who aren't taking it lightly, because, fair enough, even if personally I find the situation pretty humorous, I can see how it would be significantly less humorous if I was in it) realize the irrelevancy of the opinions of the idiot kids who made it and aren't hit too hard by it.

Still, I don't think there's any benefit to hounding the makers of the powerpoint. Won't achieve much, most likely. Plus, forgive and forget and all that stuff. Not just here, but in general. (But stop blaming /r/UPenn for making shit that was obviously not created here. I mean, seriously, that's a four year old's excuse. If you're not going to own up to it like an adult, at least put a better effort into pretending you didn't make it.)

But I find the occasional claims in defense of the slideshow-makers that there should be restraint *out of concern* for those responsible somewhat ironic (even if I think there's no point in retaliating or pursuing the case further), considering how little concern there was for the mental state of certain individuals in our class before.

0.0,1612364698.0,21.0,UPenn,"On my first math 114 quiz last friday I used a calculator on one part of the question to simplify an integral into a decimal. I went through all of the steps on my own to find the antiderivative and only used the calculator to plug in the upper and lower bounds. Although it was clearly stated in the syllabus and at the top of the quiz that calculators were not allowed, I did this because the question asked for a numerical answer and that you might not be able to give a decimal answer without a calculator. I misinterpreted this as permission to use a calculator on the last step of the integral instead of just plugging in the bounds and simplifying.

Now I have a 0% on this quiz and cannot replace it with the redo, which means that my final grade potential is lowered 7%. I emailed the professor and explained my mistake as I did in this post, but he is sticking with his initial punishment. He said that I could request to open a case to the office of student conduct, but I am afraid that if I do, they with side with the professor and then have it put on my final record.

I am part of the University of Pennsylvania Occupational Medicine Residency program and we are conducting an online study trying to learn more about COVID-19 PPE availability and perceptions and burnout. We are an IRB approved study and are not collecting any personally identifying information. We are trying to include feedback from many different groups within the medical community so we can better understand PPE availability nationwide as well as how this is impacting healthcare professionals and things like burnout.

If you work in healthcare and have a few minutes to help, please take our survey. If you don’t work in healthcare but know somebody who does, please feel free to share this study with them. We are hoping the results from this study can lead to improvements in future policies.

0.0,1611465470.0,32.0,UPenn,"Here is an overly complicated tutorial on how to set up you android home screen to automatically display your most recent PennOpenPass pass:

1. Make sure that the phone which you're using is receiving text messages whenever you get a new pass. You need to add your phone number on PennOpenPass, and maybe sign up for text reminders.
2. Go to the Play Store and download SMS Forwarder (see link in comments). Set up a filter in it as follows (leave all other settings in their default state):
   1. `Email or phone number`: Set this to any **gmail** address you have access to. We're going to be sending messages to it every time you get a new PennOpenPass pass, so choose an address where that won't bother you. Feel free to make a new email just for this, it takes like 2 minutes. For the sake of this tutorial, let's say you choose the email `name@example.com`
   2. `From who`: Set this to `+12672230163`. This is the number PennOpenPass uses to send notifications.
   3. `Rule for text`: Set this to `You have a`
   4. `Email subject`: Set this to `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass`
3. Fill out a PennOpenPass symptom check. You can do this even if you already completed one today. If we've set up everything correctly, you should receive an email with the subject `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass` which contains a link to your new pass.
4. Create a Rebrandly account (see link in comments) and create a link. We're going to set this link up to always forward to the link of your most recent pass. It doesn't matter what you set the destination to for now, just put google.com or something. You can set the link address to whatever you want, for the sake of this tutorial let's say you call the link `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`
5. Create a Zapier account (see link in comments) and create a new Zap, which should be set up as follows:
   1. In the `Gmail` option: `Trigger: New Email Matching Search in Gmail`, with the search set to `subject:([SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass)`. Make sure the email account you're using is the same one you're using with SMS Forwarder.
   2. In the `Formatter by Zapier` option: `Action: Text`, set to `Extract URL` from `Body Plain` (the body of the email)
   3. In the `Rebrandly` option: `Action: Update Branded Link in Rebrandly`, with the `Destination URL` set to the URL extracted in the previous step, and the `Link` set to the custom link you made earlier, in this case `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`.
6. Download Widgery (see link in comments) and create a new widget, whose `Web Address` is the custom link you made, `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`. You may also want to change some other settings, like turning on `When clicking on widget this will refresh the image` and `Image the same size as the widget` under `Advanced Settings`. Add the widget to your home screen (how you do this varies by device).

And we're done. If everything is working properly, every time you fill out a symptom check and get a new PennOpenPass pass, it will automatically be displayed inside the widget on your home screen (you will need to tap on the widget once to refresh it). I've only just set this up myself, so there may be some bugs to resolve, but it seems to be working pretty well.

If PennOpennPass just supported sending email alerts instead of text, or sending text alerts to VOIP numbers like Google Voice, then all of the SMS forwarding nonsense could have been avoided.",Automatically display PennOpennPass on Android home screen,t3_l3t6l9,32.0,0.95

0.0,1611358870.0,34.0,UPenn,"Hi everyone. So, with people coming back on campus and Penn’s policies around quiet periods etc, the subreddit has been the place for a lot of discussion around COVID-related topics. Unfortunately, comment sections and posts are becoming more and more heated. In fact, we’ve had to ban more users in the past two weeks than we have in the entire prior year. 

  
Going forward, we want to remind members of our general stance towards comments and posts and outline our general process around deciding what content is appropriate vs. not appropriate for the subreddit.  


1. **Please remember to be respectful.** Calling people “lame”, “losers”, “narcs” etc or wishing ill will upon them is not the way to engage in respectful discussion with others. Those comments will be hit with a removal. Repeated comments of that nature will be hit with a ban. \[This falls directly under rule #1 of the subreddit. Unfortunately, this has also been the rule that has been violated the most as of late.\]
2. **Don’t engage with the troll.** For users that have a repeated history of engaging in spreading misinformation (e.g. “covid isn’t a big deal” “students won’t get complications” “it’s just a party bro”, etc), don’t engage with them. Just point it out to the mods and we’ll see if a ban is warranted. Ways to spot a troll: usually the #1 indicator is that they have no real history of going here. Other ways = them continuing to spout misinformation despite individuals attempting to convince them otherwise. Please use the report button if you suspect someone is a troll. \[This more or less falls under rules #1 and #5\].
3. **Don’t post identifying information.** In line with reddit policy around doxxing, please refrain from posting information about addresses, locations, etc. For the individuals who are posting about parties happening, **PLEASE** approach penn about it first ([https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl](https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl) or talk to your RA). If you do feel a burning desire to post, think about redacting specific identifying information. If someone could figure it out with a couple of google searches and having a few mutual friends with the people of interest, that information should probably be shared with penn instead of the internet.
4. **Do engage in discussion with those who have genuine questions about covid.** The #1 thing I’ve seen in my MPH program is that change in people's attitudes really does happen at the individual level. If you see someone asking whether something is true or not related to covid, engage respectfully with them in the comments if you believe they’re asking in good faith. Remember, all of you are a part of a community of thousands of individuals working at Penn. It is **everyone’s** responsibility to be on board with covid guidelines so we can protect those who are most vulnerable. Accordingly, do y’alls best to convert those who are doubtful, but also recognize when a discussion is not grounded in good-faith and should probably be left alone.",FYI on COVID related mod stuff,t3_l306bd,34.0,1.0

I got into Wharton, and I plan to study finance but my EFC is 70k/year (60k based on bill needed to pay to UPenn). My dad said that he can possibly pay my first two years off, which would lead me to have an expected student loan debt of about 100k (my sister will be enrolled in college during my 4th year). My mother doesn’t plan on helping me finance my education because she doesn’t want me to go. I have to submit the enrollement deposit by Friday or withdraw my ED agreement. I would just like any advice on what I should do. I don’t want to put all this financial burden on my father, but he is really advocating for me to go.

I'm posting this again as I'd love to speak to more students.

My name is Nour Azhari and I'm a Clinical Psychology graduate from Columbia University. I am working on a research initiative to better understand **mental health on college campuses in the US**in order to develop new services that would meet those needs.

We are currently speaking to college students/recent grads who have either:

* Been referred out of their school counseling center
* Put on their center's waitlist (had to wait before your first session)

If you are one of those students, would you be open to speaking to us briefly for about 20 mins in the next few weeks? I would so appreciate your perspective, wisdom, and experience to help guide our efforts.

If you are willing to help us, please let me know what times work with you by directly scheduling a call with us: [https://calendly.com/greblernoam/mental-health-in-college-campuses](https://calendly.com/greblernoam/mental-health-in-college-campuses)

0.0,1610914305.0,25.0,UPenn,"I got admitted to Penn (CAS) through the early decision round. Initially, I thought I wanted to become a PA (physician assistant), but the more and more I researched about PAs, the less I want to pursue it. One of my top reasons for that is because I want to jump right into PA school from undergrad, but that is very rare. Another reason, is that I would have to be working a substantial amount of hours to get healthcare experience during undergrad. Thus, I believe that transferring internally to the School of Nursing would be a feasible option. If I were to become a PA, chances are I would be taking 1-2 gap years, and that is something I don't want to do. 

1. NP and PA are very similar professions (PAs have lateral mobility, but I am looking to work in general pediatrics/urgent cares/emergency medicine). A family nurse practitioner can do all of that. 
2. If I get a BSN, RN, I would have job security after undergrad (work for 1 year and gain experience and apply to NP school, or I can apply straight out of undergrad).

It does not mean that people have stopped dying in recordbreaking numbers.

- I need to focus on my mental health recovery and I’m due to start CBD in the next few months (cognitive behaviour therapy NOT cock and ball torture) so I don’t want that being interrupted as last time it took me a solid year. 

- My dog is very old and has cancer and epilepsy. She doesn’t have long left and I want to be here for her when she passes. She was my main support when dealing with the death of my dad and it’s a lot to take in. I don’t want to spiral at college if she passes whilst I’m over in the US.  (Im worried they won’t realise how much this means to me and they’ll think I’m stretching just to make a stronger case? so I’m not sure if I should include this or not, even though it’s true)

- I’d really like to take part in a volunteering programme before I start college (how specific would I need to be about this?)

0.0,1610257911.0,13.0,UPenn,"Hello hello! Off-campus housing planning for the 2021-2022 academic year is somewhat beginning to get underway. For personal use of myself and some friends planning to go off campus, I found a spreadsheet template first developed by [u/Pianoplunkster](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pianoplunkster/) at UC Davis ([original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/3wpbgy/i_made_a_spreadsheet_template_to_help_you/)) from a while back and got to work. I've included all of the original user's tips available on the second tab, as well as made some of my own immediately relevant to Penn FinAid recipients. 

I've made some minor edits to the spreadsheet itself as well as formatted it as a table to allow for easier sorting. Perhaps the most significant edit is a cost-calculator (affectionately named ""Matthew's \~ Off-Campus, Cost-Cutting Calculator Extravaganza© \~""). It provides a month-by-month assessment of the total costs of living off-campus according to the assumptions laid out to the right and is affected by changing the values of marked cells to fit your housing estimates and predictions. Some notes are added to explain some of the formulas; the only thing I would add beyond what the spreadsheet already says is that ""realization of financial aid"" can come in the form of a bigger refund (for highly aided students) or just less money paid to the University (for moderately aided students). Either way, the effect is realized when Penn handles billing in September and January.

Important disclaimers: I am a current Sophomore and thus experienced with financial aid, but in NO WAY a hardened veteran of the system. I am personally confident enough in my formulas and estimates that they are useful to me, but I am still a mere mortal and cannot guarantee the calculator will be an effective forecast, particularly if Covid remains a force in the way Penn handles FinAid when September rolls around. I recommend you personally verify any estimates yielded with your financial aid counselor. All of that said, if you find any inaccuracies or problems with the template please feel more than free to comment below and I'll try to make edits to the sheet ASAP for my benefit and to avoid misinformation.

You can find a viewable version of the spreadsheet template [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQdNyUjSPZ9QQrUP8cS6GDCAAJX7hW6n/view?usp=sharing).

The new app is intended to be a helpful mental health resource. In the future it will be used for patients in therapy, but right now we are opening it up to college undergrads for research purposes. 

**The study is 1 month long and involves a total compensation of $50. This is broken down into $15 after week 1, $15 after week 3, and $20 at the end of the study.**

The basic layout of the study is as follows:

\- you would complete the informed consent and enrollment process on the secure RedCap platform

\- you would attend a short (&lt; 30min) webinar where a researcher would explain how the app works

\- for 28 days you would complete a 11 question daily survey (should take less than 5 min each day)

\- every other week you would complete a longer bi-weekly survey (and get paid after these)

\- at the end of the study you would receive a final payment. 

**If you are interested, please follow the RedCap link below to enroll. This will lead you to the informed consent where you can find out more information about the study.**

0.0,1609611508.0,120.0,UPenn,"I am a senior right now and losing my senior year of college has been awful for my mental health. I spent my first two years at Penn struggling with depression and a serious eating disorder so I was never able to apply myself enough to join clubs or have a real social life. I spent junior year in therapy and by Spring 2020 I finally felt like myself again. I joined some clubs and felt like things were going to be okay. Then covid happened. I still felt hopeful because I thought senior year would be the year where I came into myself and would be able to apply everything I had learned to have a great year and graduate feeling proud of my college experience. I truly believe my senior year would have been amazing and made up for the disappointing college years that came before.

Instead I've been stuck in an abusive home environment for a year and will be graduating with very little to show for my college experience. I am so sad that my year will be the only Penn class to have never gotten hey day, feb club, and we possibly won't get graduation either. I had saved so many interesting classes to take my senior year and now I'm having to take them online, which I have a really hard time staying engaged with. I learned almost nothing this past semester online even though I'm taking the most important classes of my major. It makes me incredibly sad that I will never again experience an in person lecture or study in our libraries again. I'll never be able to go to Smokes. All the things that make college worth it, completely stripped. My personal, social, and academic life have all taken serious hits and I don't have another year of college to make up for it.

I guess this is just a post venting about covid and senior year but also I wanted to know if other seniors are experiencing this? No one is talking about it. It felt like the whole world felt bad for the Class of 2020 because they missed two months of college but the Class of 2021 is missing our last 1.5 years of college. (disclaimer that I know this is nothing compared to the actual losses people have experienced this year) I wish the Class of 2021 Board would have some kind of event where we could all reflect and have collective grieving over what we have lost. Because right now I just feel totally isolated and like I'm the only one having such a hard time and missing what could have been of our senior year. It truly feels like grief at this point because I feel so stuck; always thinking about what could have been and also having no way to make it better because there's no way out of our present circumstances.",Grief over losing senior year,t3_kp2hac,120.0,0.94

I am currently an undergraduate freshman and I honestly found CIS110 to be one of the least enjoyable classes I have ever taken in my life. I did some coding with Python in HS and thought the transition to Java wouldn't be so bad, especially since this course is branded as an introductory course.

The first few weeks weren't too bad and I felt like I was enjoying using Java. However, then came objects and it was right around the pass/fail deadline. I was hesitant about changing to pass/fail because I thought it was just the objects week that was going to be hard for me and because I plan to major in math where computer science can often times be important. However, that turned out to be a huge mistake. Ever since objects, my performance in the course plummeted. Trying to understand stuff from office hours and Piazza just took too much time and kept falling behind.

What absolutely sucks about this course is that they don't let you use any outside help. Whenever I couldn't understand stuff for a course in high school, I would just get a tutor, but they don't permit that here. Therefore, if you don't like the teaching style, you are screwed. It also just means your questions will take longer to be answered, which is incredibly inefficient. I talked to some older students from other universities who have taken computer science and they said their courses allow searching stuff up as long as you don't plagiarize stuff. I get that CIS110 is the university's course and not another university's, but the justification feel disingenuous to me. Them saying that StackExchange/Yahoo answers ""will likely be snarky, irrelevant to the assignment, or detrimental to the learning goals of the assignment,"" in my view, is an utterly contrived and dishonest reason.

I ended up with a D in this course. I am so upset at myself. I wasn't able to complete any of homework after the objects week because it got way too hard. I couldn't make any non-trivial progress on the final project. It didn't help that the homework was so project-based about material you just learned. I get that real life computer science is about projects but that's the phase where you are applying and should be more experience. At the learning phase, going to the deep end so suddenly throws me off.

I hate this. I hate how the stars all misaligned against me to screw me over. I hate how this course is so one-dimensional. I hate how this D is stuck on my transcript.

""I've been spending the last two days grading the final. I'm actually almost done. One thing that happens when you grade 96 finals back to back is that you start to notice trends. In particular when people get the same weird (and wrong) answer, have gibberish and then the correct answer, or just do the problem in a style that is a bit off.

Well - it turns out that most of the exam is up on Chegg. It might not surprise you that two of the solutions are wrong (!) (you get what you pay for). Needless to say, it is pretty straightforward for me to identify patterns whether they came from Chegg or your friend.

Once I bump this up to the University, it is out of my hands. If do bump it up to the University, I will follow through on my promise about your future. I have seen the future, and it is not good.

On the other hand, you can come clean *right now*. Not tomorrow, not after I send you a personal email - now. In other words I have already identified a few exams. So, you should consider yourself already caught. Do yourself a favor and minimize the damage by contacting me. This goes for anyone who *knows* anyone who cheated. You can contact me and I will make sure it remains anonymous. If you are in that grey area where you gave your answer to, or helped someone - If I find out, you both go down. If you let me know and make your case, it will be easier for you.

You have until Noon ET December 27th. 

To the vast, vast majority of you who worked so very hard this semester, I really do hope you have a great break! It will be a bit hard for me to assign grades until I work this out, but I will get it the process started. Sorry about that!

Assuming, rent and average utilities is 1000, I'd pay ~5000 upfront.

 Given that I'm highly aided and would expect to receive a refund for housing and dining of around 14k in September, that would mean I'd have around 9000 left over (if I were to deduct the costs I paid using my own money) for rent from September to around April (given that my last months rent is covered and the security deposit covers another month), I would have around 2000 left. 

I haven't even included the cost of food yet or unexpectedly high utilities, so in reality, I don't see how I'd be saving money or getting pocket money with refunds. 

I'd love to have more freedom, especially going into next fall but at this point the cost of living seems concerning. If I were to stay on campus I'd basically get a 4000~5000 refund for meals, which is more than anyone really needs so financially, I'd be saving more actually staying on campus. 

However, it would be annoying given that I'd most likely be stuck around a bunch of sophomores in the highrises as an upperclassmen, but since I do have a little seniority in the housing process, I could possibly get a single apartment.

Went to get tested for the first time today since they switched, and I guess I thought it was gonna be a cheek swab or something? Instead you have to stand there and spit into this little bottle until it fills halfway, which felt very messy and unsanitary and requires you to keep your mask off while standing there spitting. 

Also you can’t eat or drink anything for 30 minutes before the test, otherwise they said it would come out inconclusive. I just feel like that’s gonna be really hard for undergrads to follow, especially because I’ve seen how hard it’s been to get anyone to follow any basic health instructions/inconveniences this semester (speaking as an undergrad myself). I’m worried that people are gonna show up to the test just after breakfast or lunch or snacking and not care if they get an inconclusive. (Which maybe gives penn plausible deniability?)

It also was fine today since it was mostly empty, but they did have these dots spread 6ft apart I’m assuming for people to stand on when the campus returns. I feel like that’s not enough distance for college students to stand there and spit?? I really don’t want to go in for a saliva test and just having someone standing so close behind me with their masks off and actively spitting.

Also...what is this myth that seniors get priority in class placements so they can finish requirements before graduation??? because half the classes I registered for, and put at the top of my registration list, I did NOT get. 

I know a lot of people are probably in the same boat. Any word on P/F policy next semester or any ideas about how we can express to admin that next semester won't be any diff/easier than this one?",P/F Spring Sem,t3_kd198d,46.0,0.91

* What's the exchange student experience like in general? Does anyone know any past exchange students I could get in contact with?

* We do not believe that those protocols have direct implications for graduate students who live in apartment settings and engage in laboratory research regulated by other workplace protocols.
* In light of the ongoing public health risks to our community, we discourage undergraduate students from moving to Pasadena in order to live near campus.
* The Undergraduate Deans' Office and Office of Residential Experience will establish virtual living/learning groups for first-year students, with regular interactions and engagements with an assigned faculty advisor and undergraduate peer and graduate mentors.

I hope you could look at my profile and recommend whether I should spend as much energy and time on adding ECs (I’ll keep doing the ones I already am) or should I accept that I’m probably not getting in.

Hybrid on-campus / online model: 

&gt;""A pre-approved list of courses that require in-person activity will be  offered on campus, with all other courses being conducted remotely.""

On-campus residency:

&gt;Rooms in all on-campus undergraduate residences will be limited to  single occupancy. This will reduce student density in the residences and  will maintain an appropriate student-to-restroom ratio. For fall term,  and perhaps for the remainder of the 2020-2021 academic year, Avery and  the South Houses will be reserved as quarantine and isolation spaces for  residential students in the event a student falls ill or becomes  symptomatic.

Who gets to be on-campus: 

&gt;To support the limited re-occupation of on-campus residences, we  expect to invite undergraduate students to campus in the stages that  follow. It is important to emphasize that changes in public health  conditions and government directives at any time may restrict our  ability to accommodate all groups of students.  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Continuing students whose essential academic progress this year requires enrollment in courses with in-person components.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. International students whose presence on campus is required for maintenance of immigration status.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Students  who demonstrate that their personal, financial, or academic situation  requires special consideration for on-campus housing.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. First-year  and new transfer students, along with some upper-class student advisors  to support the residential experience of other students.  
&gt;  
&gt;Depending on availability of space, continuing students who may have a  nonacademic reason to be on campus, such as student athletes, also may  have an opportunity to return to campus.

House system:

&gt;While we understand that house affiliation in an important part of  the residential experience for many undergraduate students, the current  limits on occupancy and requirements for maintaining quarantine and  isolation space will not allow us to offer rooms in all of the houses.  For this reason, we will be making spaces available in the undergraduate  residences in the fall term, but we will not be reopening the houses.  House communities and the house experience will remain virtual for the  fall term and likely for the coming academic year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Similarly, the  restrictions on social gatherings and activities prohibit Caltech from  being able to allow for Rotation, a valued Caltech tradition that helps  welcome new students to campus and inaugurate the academic year.  Rotation activities are intensively and extensively social in ways that  are risky and inappropriate given COVID-19 conditions. For these  reasons, Fall term rotation has been cancelled, and the assignment of  incoming students to house communities will be discussed with student  leadership during the fall term.

I've found one other person that will be here until December and we also found an apartment at 211 S Wilson that we are interested in moving to where the rent will be $800 per person (with utilities included) and a $666.66 security deposit per person. Alternatively, if we stay at my current dwelling both of the rooms are around $833-$900 per month - not sure exactly as the rent hasn't been split evenly. The current place is at 987 E Del Mar. Both apartments are 2 bedrooms and 2 baths with hardwood floors, AC, a laundry facility or in unit (respectively), 2 parking spots, normal kitchen amenities, etc. The Wilson one might be nicer though as the current place has been lived in by many generations of students. Also, utilities are not included in the rent at the Del Mar apt. We also have the living room fashioned into my bedroom and both bathrooms are in the actual bedrooms which has not been a large issue over the years but is part of the reason we are looking to move (so I don't wake anyone at night). The apartment on Wilson is described as ""mostly furnished"" which translates into having a bed ready for you and a small looking desk+chair in the living room that id be happy to give up. Both are essentially a 3ish minute walk to campus if not for the pesky traffic light! The Del Mar apartment is also furnished for obvious reasons - but you may have to pay my current roomates for the furniture. 

All manner of people are welcome, including grad students and visiting researchers, etc. We're looking for one person for a year long lease starting in September and another person to switch out after/around new years (so January-end of August 2021).

0.0,1586791274.0,13.0,Caltech,"Sorry to fill the sub with another one of these posts. Currently I'm leaning towards Caltech over CMU, but I have a few nagging concenrs I'd like to get y'all's opinion on. Obviously, I’m unable to visit either school before I have to make the choice.

Quick background on me (skip to the numbered part if you don’t care): My primary interest is in Robotics, I’d likely take additional classes in EE/ME/Robotics/CDS regardless of where I go. On CS, I’d say I’m slightly more practically oriented than theoretical (in subject area, not looking for an SWE degree), but that doesn’t mean I’m not excited about PLT/Category theory, cryptography, or the mathematics of distributed systems.

From what I’ve been able to find so far, Caltech offers challenging CS courses, if admittedly challenging in a different way than CMU. I’m not the biggest fan of the core requirements and lack of AP/college credit; some quick math showed that ***40% of all credits at Caltech will be spent taking core requirements***, (assuming 5 classes for 12 quarters averaging 9.7 credits each) compared to 23% at CMU. I’d be curious to hear more about the value of that.

My main concern is about the depth/breadth of CS classes and the variety/availability of research positions in CS/Robotics.

1. Did/does the core requirements get in the way of other classes you wanted to take? Do you plan on doing anything with the things learned in core classes? CS Alumni: Do you wish you had taken more CS or more other stuff?
2. Have you ever felt that a CS course lacked depth/breadth? How theoretical vs. practical are the curriculum offerings? Alumni: did you feel prepared for industry work, and what do you do?
   1. My concern stems from [posts like this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-Caltech/answer/Jessica-Su) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sn9lg/where_should_i_go_for_undergrad_cs_berkeley_or/c4ffi82/). Quote: ""Now that I've spent some time at Stanford, I think my Caltech experience was limiting.  There were entire fields of CS that I hadn't heard of before coming to Stanford (like programming languages and HCI).  Also we didn't have a lot of systems classes, so when I got to Stanford I had to take a lot of breadth requirements that most students placed out of.""
   2. Looking at the course catalog, most bases seem to be covered. From the best I can tell, notable omissions include compilers/optimization, possibly reinforcement learning, and several courses not offered this year, without any information about their return.
3. I know there are ample research opportunities at Caltech, and that they are fairly easy to get. My concern is the availability of positions in things I’m interested in that involve meaningful work. This stems from the small size of the CS department, combined with anecdotes like [this one](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-Caltech/answer/Martin-Michelsen): “It seemed to me that there were plenty of opportunities for research, but not many of them were pure CS; most opportunities were collaborations with other departments.” How much choice is there in research opportunities?
4. How common is it to take graduate courses?
5. (for alumni) Has core actually helped you in your career? What have you used it for? Has the Caltech “network” helped you at all?

**TL;DR:** 1. How much does core interfere with work in your major? 2. Does the smaller offering in CS courses reflect lack of depth in topics? 3. How much choice is there in research opportunities?",Help ease my concerns choosing Caltech over CMU for CS,t3_g0kz2v,13.0,0.94

I am an EU student, thinking of studying EE, currently leaning towards Caltech quite a bit!

**Caltech**:

Pros:

* More financial aid, so would be cheaper (nearly no debt after graduation)
* Many undergraduate research opportunities at places like NASA JPL, LIGO
* Unconditional offer
* Weather is much nicer
* Much smaller (could also be a con)
* Professors are very approachable
* Ability to take a minor in another subject

Cons:

* Very far away from home
* Located in suburbs, not a very ""student city"" feeling (I have not been on campus, though)
* Not such a diverse atmosphere (few international students, generally STEM majors)
* Not such a wide range of clubs

**Cambridge**:

Pros:

* Much closer to home (geographically and culturally)
* 4 years for a masters degree
* Very diverse atmosphere (a lot of international students, STEM among humanities, etc. majors)
* Cambridge is an amazing city
* Wide range of clubs
* Supervisions

Cons:

* Conditional offer (won't know if I got admitted for 100% until August)
* More expensive
* Not as much freedom in choosing what classes to take/switching majors, taking a minor
* Not as many opportunities for undergraduate research

Edit:

Adding onto my question here's a little more insight as to what I'm looking for in my CS education (this is just a copy of the response I gave to hypercube42342 when they asked me what I was exactly looking for):

""My definition of better is more like at which school would I get deeper CS knowledge and experiences. Additionally, my goals are definitely to go into the corporate world after my undergrad and I am not interested in higher education like a Ph.D. So I guess the main traits that would be good for me are developing a strong CS foundation, being able to learn cutting-edge topics in CS like machine learning and quantum computing, definitely getting enough practical experience (I'm concerned by the focus on theory at Caltech), and lastly I'm also looking for getting good CS internship opportunities during the summer as well as research throughout the year.

My main concern in comparing UW to Caltech was that UW CS is ranked higher for CS than Caltech and that the UW CS department is getting a lot of funding.""

Our problem is specifically how to minimize risk for viral transmission during airway management. Intubation is amongst the highest risk procedure for these patients, yet is necessary in critical patients. A Taiwanese anesthesiologist came up with a design for a simple cheap box for cleanable particle limiation. Please see the following for a basic schematic: https://sites.google.com/view/aerosolbox/design

I think it could be done better, and if engineered to be produced at scale could save a lot of healthcare workers. Please let me know if anyone on this subreddit would be interested in helping.

Thank you.
Brian Hondorp, MD

Edit:
Wow! Thank you everyone for responding, I wasn’t sure I’d get any responses.

Here are where I see the current limitations with this design:

1) Arm range of motion. Some patients, particularly those with “difficult airways” require more manipulation of the head in order to achieve a sufficient laryngoscopic view for intubation. A modification that allows for greater range of arm motion, particularly in the vertical dimension, while maintaining minimal aerosol exposure would be great. Specifically, the arm motion that would be limited by this box is head and neck manipulation to allow placing the patient in the “sniffing” position.

2) The top seam on the working side is in the direct line of sight. While not a deal breaker, it would be preferable to have ability to see through a clear panel that is perpendicular to line of sight, rather than potentially needing to look through a seam. Perhaps an angled panel would help? 

3) The bottom of the box is entirely open. It is necessary to have space to accommodate a variety of chest circumferences, as well as having space for an assistant to hand the Endotracheal tube, circuit, etc.  However, this potentially exposes assistants or other staff standing nearer to the foot of the bed to higher viral loads. I think an ideal solution would seal the bottom without being rigid. A surgical gown (or even a blanket) could be draped over the bottom for this purpose, but increases disposable costs and setup time. Is there a simple way to avoid this while providing better isolation for the bottom of the box than open air?",Physician call for help from engineers,t3_fnzqwv,24.0,1.0

I'm having a difficult time making up my mind, and I had some reservations about Caltech due to the mixed things I read on the internet. :( Could you guys give me some advice, and perhaps answer some questions I had?

1. Mental health? I read on a random thread from a while back that depression was pretty widespread at Caltech. Is this true? Do you guys think that someone with preexisting mental health issues would heavily suffer at Caltech? I'm usually a very bubbly and extroverted type of girl. However, I unfortunately have some issues with cutting. I am genuinely working on improving my mental health, and I am planning to seek help soon, but mental health was one of the reasons I felt unsure about Tech.
2. The rigor? Is the work at Caltech ""do-able"" with hard work? I've read in many places that Caltech is genuinely a humbling experience. Personally, I don't really consider myself the smartest in school. I've met far more people who are smarter in my high school journey. Although I did well in my IB program and had good test scores, I'm much more of the ""hard-working type"" than the ""naturally smart type"" (if that makes sense). I'm more than ready to be humbled by my brilliant peers, but I'm honestly worried: Will a hardworking student who is not the typical ""genius"" type be okay at Tech? Sometimes, it seems like Caltech is a place for geniuses, and I feel quite intimidated.
3. Not having free time? On average, how much sleep does a Caltech student get? How much free time did/do you guys have?
4. Fitting in? At Caltech, would I still be able to find people who are pretty chill and down to earth? I was a little intimidated by how ""nerdy"" some of the kids I met on the accepted student discord were, haha.
5. Social life? Do you still find time to socialize with others? Also, coming from a very small town in the south, I love that Caltech is near LA. Do you have time to explore LA and to go into the city?
6. Do you regret it? Do you regret choosing Caltech?

I'm a recently admitted Prefrosh who's looking to major in either ChemE or BioE. I was wondering if I could receive some advice on which to pick.

My goal is to develop and implement a more effective drug delivery system using nanorobotics; essentially tapping into the work of Dr. Qian and others and applying it to therapeutics. To do this I'd like to do research during the school year every year.

I'm struggling to pick between these majors because there are few cons to each of them from my perspective:

Cons of BioE:
- pays a lot less for just a undergrad degree, which is relevant to me because I need to pay down 80k of student loan debt between undergrad and getting a PhD. A lower paying job means more years between undergrad and PhD.
- Maybe be harder to get a job in the pharmaceutical industry between undergrad and PhD.

Cons of ChemE:
- I have to take a few courses Im not personally interested in.
- the courseload for ChemE is far more extensive, meaning that I'd have to take at least 5 courses every term for every term in my four years. I worry that this will impede my ability to get meaningful research done during the year. 

I know this is a long post so I appreciate any advice! Hopefully someone will correct a misunderstanding I might have in my cons list, or perhaps suggest an optional way forward.

I understand that the program is competitive and demanding in the number/quality of published papers that Profs. require for graduation. However, are Profs. and the culture generally accepting and supportive of colleagues who have a little more work-life balance while maintaining high productivity?

Do most labs have students staying late and working on the weekends every single week? How competitive/collaborative is the general culture there? Are students generally happy? Do students feel generally fulfilled and satisfied? Can students balance relationships with friends/family/SO? I'm happy to work 60 hours a week, but I like doing it at on my own schedule without worrying about appearing busy. I'm competitive enough to work hard to deliver a substantial number of results relatively to my peers, but I hate to sacrifice quick, day-to-day activities that make me happy just to appease my boss or work culture. Do students generally have a good dynamic between each other, or do students get butt hurt at each other, depending on whether or not they are making progress on their projects?

I'm a 3rd year undergrad (just finished second year) on a Maths and Physics course at a university in the UK. I'm currently doing a similar program to SURF at my own uni, with a particle physics professor, so I do have some relevant experience. I finish on the 7th. I've asked if he knows anybody at Caltech but he says he doesn't, but he suggested that one other professor might so I'll email him soon. 

I'm more interested in the theory side of particle physics so would prefer to work in the particle theory group but would be open to the experimental side too.

The particle group at my uni is relatively young but has a good reputation and has it's hands in pretty much all the major experiments going on around the world. My current supervisor is also fairly well known (I think but my only experience is at my own uni so that might bias me a bit) but he and the group are established enough that I think the Caltech professors will be aware of them.

So if anybody has experience applying to SURF from outside the US or even just from a uni outside of Caltech any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also any advice about SURF/the particle professors from someone at Caltech would be good too.

* Chemistry: chem 1, chem 2, orgo 1, orgo 2, [lecture and labs], biochem 1, biochem 2, analytical, physical chemistry,

Upperclassmen will no longer be involved in the sorting of freshmen into Houses, and the freshmen’s preferences will be the sole determining factor in their assignment. The explicit goal is for freshmen to ultimately choose where they will live before they ever arrive on campus.

The verdict was made unilaterally and inserted at the last minute to a housing plan years in the making. The students who were involved in the plan's creation were not notified of the change until late last night. You can read the document for yourself here https://studaff.caltech.edu/documents/71-bechtelplan-2-1-2018_final.pdf (Rotation material starts on page 7.)

The House system is the foundation of undergraduate excellence at Caltech – our honor code, our academic success, and our recruiting efforts depend on it. House communities are also a critical part of the mental health safety net that keeps Techers sane and alive.

A threat to the House system is a threat to the continued existence of Caltech as a first-class undergraduate institution, and an affront to the entire Caltech undergraduate and alumni population.

This is likely the biggest threat the House system has faced since its founding in 1931.

In response, a group of concerned faculty is convening an open gathering in support of Caltech's international scholars. All students, postdocs, staff, and faculty are invited. A plan for this event was presented at a recent Institute-wide faculty meeting and was met with overwhelming support.

This gathering will take place next Wednesday, March 1st, at 12:15pm, outside, at the Millikan Pond, which is on the east side of Millikan Library. Members of the Caltech community, including several faculty, will give short speeches. A primary objective of this gathering is to provide the Caltech community with the opportunity to sign a large poster with the statement:

""We, as members of the Caltech community, stand by our international scholars who have been affected by travel restrictions.""

Although the short speeches will conclude at 1pm, the poster will remain available for signing until 2pm. We encourage all who feel strongly about these issues to participate, and to sign our collective statement of support.

There are 3 other designs that I've hand-sketched but not yet mocked up in Illustrator (since they are more complicated).

My four main questions are below. I would HUGELY appreciate it if you answered even a single one. Moreover, please don't hesitate to post a reply; feedback from non-experts is especially helpful.

(1) What do you like about these designs?

(2) What color schemes do you think would work with any one of these designs? (I don't want to feel confined to orange and white, but I'm partially colorblind so I tend to not fuss over color.)

(3) What design elements are you interested in that are not represented among the 7 designs at the link above? (Feel free to provide links to images that exhibit these design elements, particularly if they are t-shirts are from universities.)

(4) What are some possibilities for back-of-shirt graphics? (Suggestions can be intended for a particular design from the given link, but they don't need to have a specific use in mind.)",Preliminary t-shirt designs.

If you too would like to contribute to better Caltech t-shirts, then post in the comments below or message me. Digital media experience (e.g. Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign) is helpful, but so are hand-sketched designs! (Although I can't promise I'll be good enough with Illustrator to faithfully render a sketch).

If you've never designed t-shirts before, here are some guidelines:

(1) Use a small number of solid colors (the cost per unit increases substantially with each new color).

(2) Don't feel constrained to Caltech colors (although if you can think up a cool orange and white shirt, more power to you).

(3) Avoid significantly altering existing Caltech symbols. The more a design deviates from guidelines listed here (https://identity.caltech.edu/standards/visual), the less likely administrators are to approve said design. You can probably deviate from those guidelines a little bit though, insofar as I've seen Caltech administration distribute Caltech gear that violates those style guidelines.

(4) Consider working with a blank t-shirt template (either in a digital media editor or when sketching) to see how the design looks in proportion with the rest of the shirt.

I am coming here for my graduate study. In graduate courses, homework worth like 70~80% of the grade.  However, in many course syllabus, the instructors point out that ""collaboration is encouraged"" when doing these homeworks. If you collaborate, you must indicate the names of person you are working with and also write out the solution independently.  

When I did my Bachelor, I almost always study by myself. ( I think group study is very inefficient because sometimes people are getting off-topic and start chatting about non-homework related stuff).   In addition, there are always be a person or two not contributing positively toward the discussion (they are just there because they want to copy solution off the smart ones).

Although I'm already two years in, I am still grappling with understanding why humanities classes are required at Caltech. About every couple of weeks I tend to oscillate between an edgy teenage voice in my head saying ""the humanities are worthless!"" and a more calming voice of reason saying ""humanities classes help you think critically and process information."" However no matter what I just can't suppress that voice in the back of my mind questioning the usefulness of the humanities courses.

I can see humanities classes being useful if done in a sincere way, but from my experience most humanities courses are not done as sincerely as faculty might hope. For example, just a few minutes ago I heard someone in my hallway exclaiming, ""I have an essay and two problem sets due tomorrow! I'm just going to BS something for the essay and hope I get an A!"" I am occasionally drawn to this type of thinking as well, even if I know how insincere it is.

All this makes me question how useful of an exercise it is to require undergraduates to take 12 humanities courses over 4 years. One response may be that humanities classes help with writing, and eventually yield dividends when it comes to scientific writing. But in that case, why doesn't Caltech have students primarily take scientific writing courses instead, or require an undergraduate research thesis? Why does writing education have to be delivered through a broad range of topics ranging from social sciences to philosophy? Another response may be that humanities classes provide a break from the sciences, but to me it seems like having no humanities requirement would be reduce stress by providing more free time to students.

Whatever Caltech's end goal for us is, why does it have to be executed through 12 humanities courses, four of which are humanities, four of which are social sciences, and four of which are wildcard courses? It seems somewhat arbitrary, and I have trouble seeing if there would be an effective difference in our educational outcomes if no humanities courses were required at all.

But the system for distributing sandwiches was cringe-worthy and anxiety-triggering. Everyone had name tags - for socializing purposes - which they had to take to the sandwich table to get their food. The caterers knew which sandwich to provide each alumnus because their order was printed on their name tag. Now, I'm uncomfortable announcing to the world my sandwich preferences; I feel like this system would have discouraged consumption of exotic sandwiches except I doubt anyone expected to be outed when they signed up. But the worst part was the layout of the name tags: all the text was in the same size and font. From a distance, I figured the name tags read, for example, ""John Doe: Class of '84"" or ""Jane Doe: Software Engineer at Microsoft,"" but as I neared the mass of awkwardly small-talking ex-students I realized to my amusement their identifiers were all of the form ""Mary Smith: Ham Sandwich"" or ""Bill Johnson: Turkey and Cheese."" Just terrible. Had I been part of the event I would have left out of embarrassment once this incompetence was revealed to me but only after snatching up my badge from the registration table as to conceal my secret identity as a ""BLT hold the onions.""

I considered lying my way into free food as I often do, but then I thought of the poor alumnus who would drive across the state in search of nostalgic moments with old buddies only to discover his meticulously planned sandwich missing, the scarlet letter pinned to his chest a constant reminder of his hunger and a testament, in the eyes of his peers, to his deeply held sandwich preferences - the very core of who he had become since graduating.

&amp;nbsp;

Over the past few months I’ve found myself typing into Google “I hate Caltech,” trying to find some satisfying anti-Caltech comments to empathize with and help me vent. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I can’t complain about Caltech to my fellow students; if you complain it looks like a sign that you personally are just doing poorly, and so you are mad. 

&amp;nbsp;

But that’s not the case. I’ve done well in classes. I passed my qualifying exam on my first try. My peers know I’m smart. But I am mad, here’s why:

&amp;nbsp;

1\. My first research advisor was unprofessional. He told me repeatedly that I ""didn’t know how to do research."" He told me that I was not working hard. He told me at one point that I didn’t know how to read. When I left his group, he said unprofessional things about me to the other graduate students in the research group. I'm still left wondering if the fact that I am a woman caused him to treat me differently. 

&amp;nbsp;

2\. My department is Really unorganized. Last year my department devised a new set of classes that are required for all new students. Almost ALL the classes I took in my first year were completely NEW classes, and the class organization, the lectures, and the homeworks had definite BUGS. We were unfortunate guinea pigs.  

&amp;nbsp;

3\. The date of the PhD qualifying exam kept being postponed, for over a month. It was the biggest test of the year, but we didn’t know if suddenly they would say, ‘Oh, we scheduled your test for tomorrow.’ If the department doesn't take the students' time seriously, how are we going to take them seriously? This kind of behavior would be unacceptable in an industry or professional setting. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

I could go on, but I don’t want to complain. I want to move on, and focus on my research. But something last week brought it all back. I read the BuzzFeed and NYT articles about two girls who were harassed by a professor. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel lucky that my first advisor wasn’t as bad as that. But he made me feel terrible, and I really did question my worth as a researcher. I felt that maybe some of the things he said to me were at least partly true. And I am a woman, and I really hope that he didn’t treat me differently because of it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve found a new advisor, and things are generally OK. 

&amp;nbsp;

**But, I still feel mad.**

&amp;nbsp;

I feel that Caltech is not giving me what I need as a researcher. The departments are very small, and I don’t have enough people to interact with. I went to a large university for my undergrad, and everyone bounced ideas off of each other. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, sometimes I stand in the main lobby of my building, at 1pm, and no one else is to been seen. Only maybe a secretary, always an older woman, will walk by, and smile at me. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Does anyone else feel the same way?**

It could be anywhere from doing some wire crimping and soldering, assembling PCBA's into housings, doing some datasheet lookups and creating footprints for Altium, or even checking/creating schematic capture and PCB layout work.

If you are interested in any or all of the above tasks, please drop me a line with what work interests you, your general background so that I can get a feel for you as a candidate, and your hourly rate that you'd like to ask.

We have a shop in Pasadena near PCC. Most of the work you can do at your place, and I can bring the material to you as needed, so you don't have to have your own transportation.

If you also do 3D CAD modeling and/or 3D printing; or have an interest in that, please let me know as well.

If you have a friend that might be suitable, please pass this on to him/her!

3) I don't have a data plan for my phone yet, so I'm gonna do this (http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/05/enable-internet-sharing-mac-os-x/). Is this okay? I read some rules about IP sharing and how it's not allowed... I'm not very sure about this sort of stuff. I'm currently using Caltech Guest, but it's kinda weak.

4) Lady at housing desk told me file sharing is strictly forbidden, so I have to quit torrenting I guess. How do you guys get your TV-fix? Netflix? Hulu? Any free sources to share?

5) Since I'm only here for a few months I am looking for a cheap data plan for my phone, and I don't need call or text, just about 0.5-1gb of data a month. So far the quotes I got were around 30 to 40 dollars each month. Do you guys know where and how I can get a cheaper data plan?

I've got a lot of euros and I want to change them to USD. Does anyone know where I can do that? I went to citibank today and they said most banks will only change it for me if I have an account with them. I don't really want to have an account.... well maybe, if necessity.

Will I get a fine if I cycle on pedestrian pathways? Smaller roads, I can deal with. But the traffic on the more populated roads (eg Lake Ave, California Blvd) scare me.

I'm an Aero sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic, working on my undergrad with the plan of going straight into Aeronautical or Space Eng in my graduate studies after I finish getting 'tute screwed.

Somehow I missed the memo about Caltech when I was looking for schools -- In my search for a small, top-tier, sociable tech school, I ended up in New England shoveling snow instead of California on the beach. As a southerner from a small town, the more I read, the more I'm falling in love with your school. Apart from the obvious benefits (I'd imagine) for my field, the atmosphere and environment seems like it's everything that's missing from RPI.

You're currently top on my list of potential graduate schools. I'm working with a 3.84gpa with positive first *and* second derivatives -- if you approximate it as a continuous function -- two active research projects, and a pretty decent network of professors and departmental references.

So, how's graduate life at CalTech? What's a typical week(end) look like? What don't I know -- what's the catch?

Academically and professionally, apart from what I know from researching the school and talking with people in the field who've attended or worked there, is there anything outstanding that's going to be different from other, similar graduate schools?

or if you just want to have a chat with an Engineer (yeah. That's our actual mascot. Creative, right?), I'm bored and mostly harmless.

TL;DR NY is cold, can I come live with you?

Thanks for the read!

Is there an undergrad who would like to be our announcements liaison to the undergrad population at Caltech? and who would be in charge of getting our info about events/classes/office hours to them through your local undergrad email lists/Facebook groups?

But I just finished my first semester at college, and it looks like my GPA isn't going to be nearly as good as I was hoping it to be. Looking back, I really screwed up in the last couple of weeks, missing a few labs and online quizes, but it seems like the highest GPA I think I could get for this term is a 2.466, though I think realistically I will be getting something more like a 2.2-2.3. This wouldn't be a problem, except I am not a caltech student, so the requirement for me is a minimum 2.5. This entire situation has me in a bit of a downward spiral as a result. On one hand, I reached out and did a bit of work to try to secure an opportunity, and on the other, I screwed up my first semester. Again, looking back I realize that I definitely didn't do as well as I could have, and if I had put in a little more effort in the final month, I would have had a much better GPA, one that wouldn't take me here for this. And looking forward to my next semester, I am positive that I will be doing much better (I will be getting some help, study groups, etc.)

My question is this; would it be possible to still apply to SURF regardless? I know that in some places, the minimum GPA is more of a ""can you do the work"" kind of thing, which is something I don't have a problem with, and I have no doubt that  my next term GPA (and my GPA for the year) will be well above the 2.5 minimum. Would it be possible to apply with the requirement that my year end GPA is high enough/use my mid-semester grades in the consideration? or am I in the very awkward position of having to let the professor know that I will be withdrawing my interest because of academic difficulties?

Was there any open discussion of this on campus beforehand, or is this out of the blue?

There was some grumbling over one of the Stanford online classes by students in the ""real"" class that their course was getting dumbed down to make it more suitable for the online audience, and that the edited online lectures were better than the in-class lectures. Are steps being taken to make sure that doesn't happen with Caltech courses?

So far, three Caltech courses have been announced on Coursera:

[Principles of Economics for Scientists](https://www.coursera.org/course/econ1scientists) by Antonio Rangel. I don't see anything saying what Caltech offline course it corresponds to, but it does say it will be taught concurrently to online and Caltech students, so I assume it corresponds to something.

[Galaxies and Cosmology](https://www.coursera.org/course/cosmo) by S. George Djorgovski. It says it corresponds to Ay 21, but doesn't say if it actually will be taught concurrently and identically to live Ay 21.

[Drugs and the Brain](https://www.coursera.org/course/drugsandbrain) by Henry A. Lester. No idea what this corresponds to.

As far as I know, Caltech has only done one other foray into full online classes with homework, exams, and discussion forums--the [Learning from Data](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) course offered earlier this year by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa, and currently being offered again. From what I've read, the online students greatly liked that class. How was it received on campus? Did having the lectures filmed and broadcast live, and having online students able to submit questions for the Q&amp;A after each class cause any annoyance for the on-campus students?

Finally, is anyone surprised Caltech is going with Coursera instead of one of the other online education initiatives? My guess would have been that when Caltech made a move into online education, it would have been by joining MIT and Harvard on [edX](http://www.edxonline.org/).",Coursera and Caltech?,t3_wznpb,4.0,0.84

City of Pasadena, CA: Improve East-West Bike Routes on Cordova Ave, Green, Union, Del Mar Ave
http://chn.ge/Melvqg

Pasadena needs to improve its east-west bike routes! Cordova Ave has been considered for a road diet for some time ( http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/Transportation/Road_Diet_FAQs/ ) and has had bike lanes installed on it east of Lake Ave. These have improved the safety of cyclists in that area. However, Cordova Ave west of Lake Ave is still intimidating to cyclists. Overall, Pasadena lacks good east-west routes for cyclists.
We petition the City of Pasadena to extend bike lanes on Cordova Ave west of Lake Ave, and to consider installing bike lanes on very wide one-way streets Green St and Union St. In addition, also consider placing bike sharrows on Del Mar Ave to improve the use of this route for cyclists. These improvements will create an east-west bike corridor for Pasadena and help make streets safer for everyone - cyclists, pedestrians, and cars alike.

Please help us by signing this petition! We aim to gather at least 1,000 signatures to present at the Pasadena General Plan Community Forum Meetings coming up on June 23 and 26.

In Ruddock House, there was a tradition called ""1 yard line."" You would yell that just as you jumped on someone who was sleeping on a couch in the common areas.  Another 10-15 guys would pile on top. That tradition died. 

Ruddock had a number of magazine subscriptions, including Playboy.  The upperclass women all demanded that the subscription be cancelled or they would all move out.  The subscription was cancelled and 10 on-campus members got their own subscriptions.  

One prank that didn't work out was the Banners in the Rose Bowl Goalposts.  The plan was to have them unfurl during halftime.  A timer to turn on the radio-controlled airplane receiver would not work reliably, so a large number of batteries were used instead and the receiver set to an obscure frequency.  These were installed 3 weeks before the Rose Bowl when security was nonexistent.  Little did we know that there would be a radio-controlled airplane exhibition 1/2 a mile away from the stadium 2 weeks before the game.....sigh.  What did the banners read?  ""Hi, Mom!

I'm a Caltech alum who got into Caltech with what was probably a typical record for Caltech students: valedictorian, near perfect SAT's, lots of AP exams and 5's on all of them, impressive math and science competition results. On iqtest.dk, which is said to be one of the more accurate online IQ tests, I scored 110, which is only considered the high end of average or slightly above average. On other online IQ tests I can't break 130. I've never taken an official IQ test, but on standardized tests as a kid, I scored very well in verbal intelligence but extremely poorly in spatial skills.

Incidentally, I found Caltech's academics to be very difficult. Post-Caltech, my success has been mediocre. I've always come across as slow to other people, including those who didn't do well in school. ","Caltech students and alumni, what is your IQ if you know it?",t3_kpwjk,0.0,0.44

More precisely, I'd like to get an idea of how reliable the Homewood‐Peabody‐JHMI Shuttle is, at least in the Peabody --&gt; Homewood direction. My intention would be to get to campus around 8.30 each morning, bearing in mind I may have to lecture at 9. Should I expect to have issues with shuttles being full, not arriving at all etc. at Peabody? Would my life be made a lot easier by just choosing to live in Hampden, for example?

I'm now considering moving my JHU app to RD, as I would be committed to pay full tuition (70k/year) if accepted to Hopkins with EDII.

However, the Data Science program seems more practical and better suited for the direction that applied math jobs are skewing as Big Data becomes increasingly pervasive.

AMS on the other hand is a tried and true path that has seen thousands of graduates receive their degrees and go on to be highly successful. Though perhaps it lacks more practical skills such as programming that the Data Science degree does a better job of covering.

0.0,1611775919.0,0.0,jhu,"Hi all,

So as I’m sure many people have noticed, we have very harsh restrictions (no people in your room, no sitting in hallways, no common areas for now, mask mandate when running alone outside, etc). These rules are obviously sparking mental health issues in many freshmen. However, I don’t really want to argue about whether they are fully justified or not right now; I understand that we have a responsibility to protect the Baltimore community. My concern is for later in the semester and looking forward to the fall.

By some point in mid March, a year after all of this really started, the vast majority of healthcare workers and elderly will have had the opportunity to receive the vaccine. This is amazing, because the vaccine so far seems to be 95% effective at preventing illness but 100% effective at preventing hospitalization. Since the vast majority of deaths (I believe 80%+, but correct me if I’m wrong) have occurred in people over the age of 65, this will reduce to death rate to be on par with a seasonal flu. On top of that, overall transmission rates will be cut as we slowly approach the heard immunity threshold.

However, because college aged students are incredibly low risk (I believe that death rate for people under 20 is .003%) we are dead last in line for the vaccine. This makes sense, if we want to reduce deaths then we need to prioritize vaccinating people who actually could die if they catch the virus. HOWEVER, it is not justified, fair, or reasonable for Johns Hopkins, or society as a whole, to continue imposing restrictions on healthy young people when the people we have been protecting for the last year are no longer vulnerable. 

The school has said the restrictions will likely remain in place for the entire semester. This is not based on actual science or data, nor is it good public health policy. Good policy takes into account more than one disease, and at this rate the risk of student suicide is likely much higher than the risk of a student COVID death. We did not have mask mandates, lockdowns, capacity restrictions, etc. for the flu, which is more dangerous to our demographic than COVID is. Therefore, it does not make any sense to continue with restrictions when COVID death rates reach the flu’s (~60k per year).

I am very concerned that the university has dug a hole that will be very difficult to crawl out of without a sensible, set in stone reopening metric. COVID zero, and even full student vaccination, are not reasonable levels to hope for before allowing a semblance of normal. I really hope everyone understands my concern and what I’m trying to say here.",COVID Restrictions after March,t3_l6ce50,0.0,0.32

I’m a student from Washington University in St. Louis. At WashU, I am a member of a non-profit organization called Heart for the Homeless. One of our projects is to create resource guides which contain low-cost healthcare options and other vital medical information that we share with clinics and the people we meet at homeless shelters. Please check out our website and [success](https://sites.wustl.edu/heartforthehomeless/national-primary-care-resources-project/npcr-project-success-stories/) stories to learn more about this initiative.

If any individuals or student groups at JHU are interested in getting involved in our project, we would love to have you join our team. We have worked with over 30 cities and would work with you every step of the way as you make resource guides for parts of the Baltimore area.

As project lead, I will be able provide you with specific instructions, templates, and other important information that should streamline the process of making a resource guide.  This is a great opportunity for pre-meds (especially during the pandemic), not to mention a great chance to address a pressing societal issue. Please check out our [website](https://sites.wustl.edu/heartforthehomeless/) for more information about Heart for the Homeless.

The Alternative Protein Project is a coalition of engineers, scientists, policy makers, entrepreneurs, writers, and other young professionals who are interested in changing the world of food through alternative proteins. Alternative proteins encompass meat, fish, dairy, and eggs made using plant-based, fermentation-derived, and/or cultivated ingredients that do not require animal agriculture. Objectives for the group include inviting guest speakers to the university, developing an alternative protein curriculum, partnering with industries in this space, discussing literature, supporting related research at JHU, and fostering a supportive environment where students can aid each other in their job quests or related projects.

The Good Food Institute helped launch 5 chapters of the Alternative Protein Project around the world just last year, including at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UNC Chapel Hill, CU Boulder, and Tel Aviv in Israel; I'm hoping Hopkins can be on the list for 2021!

The only thing that’s making me want to go to campus is a possible in person research opportunity (I’m interested in wet lab work).

JHU said that in person undergraduate research will open in the spring, but I wanted to ask if that’s actually going to happen. If they’re going to end up not opening the labs for undergrads, I’d rather not go to campus.

Is it likely that in person undergraduate research will open up in the spring?",In person Undergraduate Research,t3_kvu1yb,20.0,0.93

0.0,1610423213.0,8.0,jhu," Hello! I was accepted into Berkeley's online Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) and Johns Hopkins' online Artificial Intelligence. I have seen similar threads, but it seems that people are not representing the MIDS program correctly. Let me know if I have also made any mistakes in my assumptions.

Thanks in advance for your opinion!

**Berkeley: MIDS**

\- Very expensive (roughly $75k).

\- I was told a month ago by a counsellor that the acceptance rate is \~30%.

\- The classes are live (I would enjoy getting to know the other students).

\- Although the program is offered by the School of Information, the program is a STEM designation.

\- Works with ""2U"", but 2U does **NOT** hire the professors. The professors are full time at Berkeley. I believe that 2U simply helps them with administrative tasks and advertising?

\- I believe this program will ""ease"" me into data science more than Johns Hopkins (for example, there is an optional first program in Python).

\- I will study statistics (probably intro to statistics though), data engineering, machine learning, deep learning, time series data, and NLP.

\- Fantastic school for all things computer science related.

&amp;#x200B;

**Johns Hopkins: Artificial Intelligence**

**-** Expensive (roughly $50k).

\- Acceptance rate for Johns Hopkins online courses is high (not sure what percentage).

\- The classes do not require your participation and are not live (nice if you have variable work schedule, but not as great for building a network).

\- I will study Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, AI-enabled systems, Deep Learning, Human Robotics Interaction, NLP, Intelligent Algorithms (fuzzy systems etc), statistics.

\- Doesn't specialize in computer science, but well respected for medicine/bio engineering. Since artificial intelligence leans on human cognition, I would expect them to excel in a curriculum built for artificial intelligence?

It seems like the Johns Hopkins program covers what MIDS covers plus more. In general, I understand that artificial intelligence is within the field of data science, so perhaps the Johns Hopkins program is attempting to be more specialized.

I'm an engineer, I work with inferential models, robotics (slightly), and data wrangling, so both programs are analogous to my work. I believe I would enjoy the Johns Hopkins curriculum more. However, although Johns Hopkins is a fantastic school (and perhaps generally ""rated"" higher than Berkeley), Berkeley is higher ranked in computer science. Obviously it's silly to pick a program on rank, but I care about what others think about the program so I think it would be naive for me to completely dismiss this.",Berkeley: MIDS or Johns Hopkins: Artificial Intelligence?,t3_kvjm72,8.0,0.91

Would appreciate if one of the senior students could help out with a few operational questions ( we haven't been to Baltimore and have no idea of the area around JHU).

\- Are parents allowed to use the JHU shuttle (especially during move in)

\- What is the time for the shuttle to complete one cycle (just trying to figure out how slow or fast it is ) and does it wait at a stop for 2-3 minutes or it doesn't stop if no one waves her/his hand at the stop.

\- How easy or difficult is it to find car parking in and around the residence halls (to help with move ins).

\- Are there any unsafe areas around JHU which have to be avoided from a taking Airbnb/strolling around late in the evening perspective.

For some background information, I was in a writing-intensive class comprised of about 9 students. With special family circumstances, I was permitted extensions both for three mini essays that had been due throughout the semester, and my final essay. For the mini essays, I submitted them right at the start of the finals period, and my final essay I submitted on Christmas Eve (the original deadline had been a few days previous).

However, since my final essay *was* technically turned in more than 48 hours after the final exam was due, and my professor has not responded or acknowledged the submission of my final exam officially (like she did with my mini essays),  I guess I am a little apprehensive or curious about this lack of a grade. However, since I did have permission for the extension, and it seems based on the subreddit that the 48-hour grading deadline is more a guideline than a rule,  I may be overthinking it.

Obviously, essays take some time to grade, and the holidays just wrapped up, so I'm not trying to be impatient, especially considering my professor was seriously generous for working with me and taking into consideration my home circumstances. However, I am getting a bit antsy considering it is now the 4th of January, and there is a bit of ambiguity left in our communications.

The obvious solution would seem to email her, but as someone who already feels like they've been a burden, how do I do so without sounding impatient or bothersome? Should I give her another day or two? Am I worrying over nothing, or should I be worried because this situation is unusual? If anyone has any suggestions or experiences, please feel free to share!

i guess im just scared im gonna be all alone on campus next year lol. since most freshmen are going, they’re gonna be able to connect and make friend groups lol, which is much harder to do from home, even with covid restrictions in place at hopkins. first semester is already done and i really only know two people at hopkins, and it’s just super frustrating. i dont wanna be all alone with no friends and super lost next year when we do return. even with being remote right now, people already seem to know each other, and i literally don’t know anyone besides my roommate and like one other person.

I guess it's just really starting to hit me that I haven't really had my freshman year, and that I quite possibly never will. I admit it possibly a little bit of jealousy. Sometimes I just think about how I might start my first semester on campus as a sophomore, watching all the freshmen experience the hype of their first year and missing out on all that first year free food and first year events and orientation fun, (which I know is awkward for some people, but new people and all the new stuff can be pretty fun). Then I start to lowkey think about how Hopkins might forget about how much the '24s don't know Hopkins and we'll never get a real orientation and introduction to Hop and stuff. Realistically, this is just a long thought spiral, not a real worry I know I'm just self-indulging in my pity a little too much.

Honestly, when I take the time to step back from it, I'm well aware it's not the end of the world, and again I do *not* want any '25s feeling unwelcome, I am,  very excited for y'all to join us.

I just want to talk it out with other '24s, and I don't fully feel comfortable reaching out to any '24s that i know right now. I've tried to vent to an upperclassmen friend but they were just like, ""You don't know how good you've got it with online classes/on-campus isn't all that hype/you'd be sick of it soon anyway."" Maybe that's true, but I'd like to get sick of campus first before I decide that. I don't think they meant to be rude but it's just made me so upset when I think about it.

My mom is the same. The first thing she said when my graduation was cancelled and that I might not go to campus, she was like ""Oh whatever, it's not the end of the world/it could be worse."" I honestly am not even upset about missing my graduation, but it's so frustrating that apparently nothing that I was supposed to have matters. I know she kinda regrets it lowkey but honestly it's still in my head and I just don't have anyone else to vent to about this stuff because most of my friends actually ended up being on campus at their schools.

It's really frustrating to hear and I don't want to blow up at anyone so I figured I'd just get this all out in a subreddit post before I waste my time in an frustration/self-pity spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, not being on campus, missing a graduation, I am well aware these are necessary sacrifices, I do not regret them, and I know there are worse things in the world. It still hurts a little, though.

* Is the ""stress culture"" a significant part of student life? From what I've heard, schoolwork can regularly take up to 14-18 hours per day, and while I'm obviously going to college with the expectation that I'm there to study, that sounds a little insane outside of a few days/short periods per semester
* Are there things to do outdoors (hiking, biking, skiing, fishing, etc) within a reasonable distance of the city and in financial reach of a broke college student?
* I've heard from admissions presentations that it's easy enough to study or double major across fields (in my case, engineering and international relations), but I was wondering what the student perspective was on double-majoring
* As I understand it, Hopkins is similar to most schools in that social life revolves around frat parties. Is it easy to find somewhere to be on a Friday night, or are those communities pretty insular? Realistically, do students even have time to leave the library for more than an hour at a time?
* Lastly, does campus feel like a tight community, or more like a loose group of people the same age that happen to be in the same place? I'm sorry I can't phrase that better, but I've heard that there isn't a strong sense of community or ""school spirit"" from students.

I've spoken to an alum that loved their experience with the school, but they were here 25+ years ago, so I figure a lot has changed from the student perspective.

I just took one of my finals and got one of my grades submitted for another class. I feel very unsure about my final and the grade I received was a letter grade lower because of a dumb mistake I made by forgetting to submit one assignment. I'm feeling really defeated this semester. I have two more finals left- one being the orgo final for principe/greenberg which I know is going to be horrible. I feel like I'm not making the grades I wanted and I'm feeling incredibly defeated. like incredibly defeated.

I’m aware of what has gone on here in the last few weeks and why you all feel so strongly about Dr. Wierman. I agree how he handled the semester was not the best. However, I feel like the subreddit and for the most part, the student body has taken this outrage way too far.

This semester has been an unprecedented one for all of us, especially due to COVID. This has forced us to change a lot about our traditional learning methods.  I think that in our frustration towards digital learning, we’re forgetting about the struggle that our professors have to deal with. Now, they all have to transfer their in-person curriculums into virtual ones. Not only is this a hard task for anyone, but it is extremely difficult for someone who isn’t as familiar with technology as our generation. And honestly, I’m quite happy with how Dr. Wierman was able to adapt his course to an online setting given these circumstances. He was considerate and open-minded about the tolls of virtual learning, even going as far as getting rid of all tests and quizzes.

Dr. Wierman was also forced to deflate grades in order to fix the flawed grading distribution for the roughly first half of the semester.  Around 80% of the class had at least an A-. I know we all want good grades, but it is an unrealistic expectation to have that distribution remain unchanged by the end of the class. Even now, you’re all expecting to hear that Dr. Wierman became a tyrant, failing everybody and causing mass pandemonium. That couldn’t be farther from the truth! In the last time that he shared grade distributions with the class, over half of students still had at least an A-, and 86% had at least a B-. Only 1 student had a failing grade.

Grades aside, Dr. Wierman had to be very concerned about the integrity of the class given the online modality, and thus, forced him to take all accusations seriously. This includes the textbook incident earlier in the semester, in which a group of students used the answer key to the textbook to gain an unfair advantage in the class over my peers. This outrages me that fellow students would try to do this knowing they are taking advantage of the system and is 100% unsustainable. Relating to the tutoring incident, I think that Wierman was right to look deeper into the situation. Now, I was uninvolved with the group chat and the finer details of the situation, but my gist of it is that a student was giving help despite Wierman telling the class that providing such help would be inappropriate. JHU is a prestigious institution lauded for its rigor and quality of education. To see my fellow classmates try to undermine this aspect of what makes our school so special makes me extremely upset. Reading more about the situation, I agree that the situation was handled quite poorly, but I still stand by the idea that it was conducted with good intentions.

To close it all off, I just want everyone who thinks they have a good understanding of the situation to reflect on what happened. A lot of the Fall 2020 Intro Prob class was lackluster, but a lot of the hate surrounding the class is/was unwarranted and overblown.",INTRO PROB: In Defense of Dr. Wierman,t3_k9lf5a,0.0,0.39

So this survey blew up.  So far, I've gotten about 50 responses with 8 people having matches.  This number could be higher if people took this into consideration:

1. **People who provide a lot of detail are a lot more likely to find a match.**  If you're interested in making a submission, please provide a comfortable amount of detail.  I've deleted submissions that are overly broad since I know I won't be able to match you with anyone.
2. **When I set up matches, I prioritize values over interests.**  For instance, I don't set people up who have different religions or political views unless they expressly state they are open to other political views.  **It will be easier for me to find a match for you if you prioritize talking about your values.**
3. If you provide a height preference, please know that most people don't provide their own height information so I might pair you up with someone who doesn't meet your height preference.  This goes for appearance and athleticism too.  Some people have said they prefer people with certain types of hair or skin tones but not everyone provides a photo of themself in their submission. Some people say they want a dude who is athletic but only a couple dudes provide information about how frequently they work out or how invested they are in sports.  This also goes for responses like ""he must give me space"" or ""they must be socially aware"", since I can't predict that through a survey.
4. Y'all are funny with your potato &amp; salad jokes lol
5. If you want to find a match then the best you can do for yourself is spread the word about the survey!  **Heterosexual men are underrepresented in this survey lol**
6. Feel free to make an additional submission.

EDIT: Over 80 submissions.  Please be patient hehe, I'll get to it after I'm done with finals in the next several days.

0.0,1606980320.0,15.0,jhu,"Hello to everyone ""on the other side of the gap""! I'm currently a high school senior from Florida with a considerable interest in Hopkins, and so I figured I'd interrupt the regular talk about your classes and such to ask a couple of questions.

First, I'd like to say that I visited Hopkins a couple of years ago (before the end times) as part of the summer immersion program, and I absolutely fell in love with its campus and culture. I know I only saw a ""PG"" version of it, but still. Baltimore is a beautiful city with beautiful crab cakes— I mean history.

Anyway, gushing aside, I have a couple of questions on admissions for you veterans of the process. Having decided that Regular Decision would be my best bet, I went ahead and submitted as much as I could bright and early so I wouldn't have to worry about missing anything later. Still, on the admissions portal, it says I'm missing an ""AP Score report"", and therein lies the problem.

I'd like to think I have fairly competitive stats in most respects (5s, a couple 4s, 1550 SAT, decent GPA, etc), except for one pesky quarantine AP Test that I may or may not have completely failed. Now, this isn't a ""chance me"" post (my nerves are already wracked as it is, I don't need internet strangers telling me I won't make it to this or that college), but I'd like to ask if AP Score reports are to be turned in as part of the admissions process. I did self-report my scores (all except the mentioned ""icky score"") on the common app, but I'm not sure if I am now required to submit my official scores.

Aside from that clarification, I guess I'd also like to ask for advice on dealing with the application process. This need not be only related to Hopkins— I just wanted to ask how you all dealt with the anxiety of waiting for your college admissions results.

To all of you who have made it, warm greetings from Florida. It is now 2:20 AM and my college admissions anxiety has no signs of stopping, but at the very least I hope this post will help a hopeful like me in the process.",Hello JHU Students!

If you fill out the survey, I'll use your results to create a match based on other responses.  I'll select a match based on characteristics you desire in a partner.  I won't reach out to you if I don't think you have a good enough match.  But if you have a match, I'll reach out to you and your match and provide your survey responses to each other.  If you're both interested in meeting, I'll put you in touch.  In the meantime, spread the word, since the more people fill out this survey, the more likely they'll find someone on campus who meets their interests.

This survey isn't entirely anonymous.  For one, if you like, you can provide a photo of yourself.  But you're required to provide some sort of contact information (email, social media link, etc) so that we can reach out to you once we get a match.  We won't use the email/social media you provide for any purposes other than reaching out to you (we don't have a use for it anyways lol).  **If you're paranoid about sharing your information, then you should only provide responses you would be comfortable with the whole world seeing.**  Otherwise, make sure you're as specific and as detailed as possible to make sure you get an optimal pick.

Once about 50 people take the survey, I'll start contacting people with their matches.  **I'll routinely update this post with the number of people who have taken the survey.**  Cheers!

EDIT 1: 5 responses so far

EDIT 2: so close to finding a match, but they were both girls looking for dudes :(

EDIT 3: 10 responses :)

EDIT 4: This survey is becoming increasingly popular.  I'm not ready to employ an algorithm with this survey unless I were to get hundreds of submissions, because I think an algorithm can risk making less accurate matches than if a Hopkins student reviewed it.  Feel free to provide survey question suggestions.  Also, more men need to take this survey.  Too many female submissions lol

0.0,1605380288.0,179.0,jhu,"Hi yall,

I know you guys have probably seen this 1000 times now, but this is yet another Intro to Probability post. I’m the freshman that was accused of academic dishonesty, and tldr is that the meeting between Dr. Wierman and the Ethics Board member didn’t seem to go very well, as I didn’t feel I couldn’t effectively get my point across and have him understand my stance on the issue. The report apparently claimed I was freely handing out answers to homework and illegally assisting students, which is not the case. I think this was reflected in the punishment within settlement document that he proposed that I don’t think I want to accept tbh. However, I am not fully decided on what to do. The description of the actions is described in other posts, so I wont delve in there, but I truly don’t feel I violated ethics guidelines. Thus, I have a few questions regarding settlements vs board meetings. For general background info, this is my first academic ethics offense.

1: If I accept the settlement, how does it appear on my transcript/academic record? I don’t think I could accept this proposal if it appears there, as that strongly hurts my integrity

2: How often do board meetings really overturn the decision/go in favor of the student? I’m worried about this especially the work that would need to go into it, and I don’t want it to be for nothing

3: If I am convicted at the board meeting, does that appear any differently anywhere than if I accept the settlement and it appearing in my record?

4: Is there anything I can do regarding the professor violating my rights/not following proper procedure? Short of it is that it appears he talked to another professor about this situation before the meeting yesterday looking for guidance on how to punish me, and it appears the word “freshman” was used in the description, of which there are only 2 of us, which means it’s easily traceable back to me. Whoever he discussed with advised I should be expelled, which I don’t think is reasonable at all. Additionally, it states in the ethics process that the professor should promptly discuss with the student the concern before the ethics board, in which this did not occur, nor was the discussion prompt after the event, as it appears the complaint was received on October 30, and this is 2 weeks later now.

5: Is illegally obtained evidence admissible in an ethics board meeting? Florida (where I reside) and Maryland are both 2-way consent states, meaning that someone turning in screenshots to the professor would have needed consent from myself to screenshot in the first place, which I explicitly said at the beginning I was not comfortable with, especially because it had my face in it. 

6: Similarly to an earlier question, if I am off the hook after the ethics board meeting, how does this appear, if at all?

7: For anyone that has had an ethics board meeting before, any advice that you would give or any information I should know beforehand that I didn’t ask above?

Thank you so much in advance for any thoughts or input on any of these :) I’m pretty saddened by this scenario that I have to deal with, but I appreciate the huge amount of support from everyone inside and outside of this class.",Academic Ethics Questions,t3_ju74qi,179.0,1.0
0.0,1605345005.0,155.0,jhu,"I'm sure many of you already know about the group chat incident. It's absurd that Wierman would even consider it academic dishonesty. As far as I know, no one was cheating or copying answers or anything of the sort. It consisted of things we would do in a normal in-person semester - studying together, working together, peer tutoring, etc. and I don't know why Wierman is so stuck up about it. It's ridiculous that he thinks he can prevent students from discussing homework. It's just homework, not a midterm or a final or an exam of any kind.

Between the BS grading, the constantly changing policies, the utter contempt Wierman has for students, and the lack of actual teaching, I'm not sure what exactly is going on anymore. The essays he posts on Blackboard responding to our complaints are so passive aggressive I don't even know what to make of them, and they purposely misrepresent what most students are complaining about. And it feels like each time Wierman does address our concerns, it's some form of malicious compliance. Did anyone notice how difficult the homework for Friday was? Less problems for sure, but the difficulty was much harder than past homework assignments. It's clear he wants us to fail for the sake of his grade distribution.

What really pisses me off though is that a freshman is at risk of being expelled simply for helping students when the instructor and TA's wouldn't. And what sickens me is that another student reported the incident - a student that presumably benefited from the group chat and the zoom study sessions as much as everyone else. JHU already has a reputation for being cutthroat and full of snakes, and I'm angry that this student would try so hard to live up to this stereotype. To make matters worse, it seems like Wierman is trying to figure out who else was in the group chat and zoom calls to punish them as well. The group was one of the few places where I actually felt like I had support in the class. Despite all the BS we had to go through, at least we had each other to turn to. It was literally the only resource students had to get help because of Wierman's unreasonable policies. Now a freshman may have a stain on his record for the rest of his academic career and everyone who was in the chat is at risk of an academic dishonesty violation for simply helping each other and working together to get through this atrocious excuse of a class.

I know this has been said over and over and over again, but please email Dr. Santosa. If you already emailed him before, email him again about this new incident. If you need the email template, message me. Ask for the freshman to not get in trouble, ask for Dr. Santosa to mediate a meeting between the students and Wierman, and emphasize how toxic and cutthroat this class has become. We might not have a group chat anymore, but at the very least we can all pressure the AMS department into ensuring that something like this never happens again.

* All lectures are pre-recorded from a different semester so there are no opportunities to get clarification

* Not a *single* assignment or the midterm has been graded. So I can't really assess his expectations. This is not a huge deal, but it's annoying. 


* He has never answered an email about questions about class. 

* We have a large assignment worth a big portion of our grade that is due soon and it hasn't even been posted yet. 

* The lecture units are supposed to be released every Mon, he has never once posted it on time. Sometimes he's posted the notes on Friday. 

I noticed he not teaching next semester so I wonder if he's been laid off and decided to do a crappy job because he doesn't care.

However, I just wanted to get a pulse check, to see what everyone else is planning for next semester, because I am feeling rather unsure and alone.

Normally, I would love to go back to campus. I miss that place like crazy, especially as a sophomore who barely got to experience time there at all. I want to get back to some normalcy in terms of schooling, I want to be able to be in Baltimore again, and I want some individuality back. But, I don't think it's going to be possible for me. Considering the pandemic is still reaching record-high numbers, I'm not sure going back to campus is something that rests easy with me. Also, I have an ailing grandmother at home that may pass while I'm away, so I think I'd rather stay home an extra semester to be close to her. And, there's the plus of not having to pay for housing.

Anyway, I would feel confident in my decision to stay home, as it seems to work out better for me in terms of safety, family, and financial situation; however, I don't really have an idea how this hybrid scenario is going to play out, and can't help feeling students who stay home are going to get the short end of the stick here. I just feel I'll remain very isolated; I have no idea how online attendees and live ones could even interact, I'm worried about missing positions in extracurriculars such as Blue Key, and I already don't have many friends.

0.0,1604564616.0,3.0,jhu,"So I’m currently a sophomore and just got into a co-op program with an organization in Maryland near Hopkins. I’m really interested in it, but the logistics of the program may prove to be more trouble than it’s worth.

For one, the program is designed such that you work full-time for one semester, and then you return back to school full-time for one semester. So my first question would be: does Hop allow for this sort of staggered leave of absence schedule, or are you limited in how much time you can take off? 

You have to work for a total of 52 weeks to finish the co-op program, so if I’m calculating this correctly, I would have to do at least 3 semesters of work (which means I graduate a year and a half later) plus a summer there. That leads to my second question: would I lose out on financial aid if I took too long to graduate, or would the financial aid still carry over as long as I haven’t finished my degree? I get most of my aid from institutional grants, so it does concern me a little. 

My third question has to do with housing. The work location is really close proximity to Hopkins, so my thought was that I could just commute from my apartment, but then I realized I would be on leave of absence during this time. Would Hopkins student-designated apartments still be available to me while I’m working, or would I have to find my own housing since I’m no longer a student during that period? 

Sorry for all the questions, I know it’s a lot, but I’m just super nervous because I only have 2 weeks to respond to the employer and I want to figure out everything before I make a decision. I don’t want to turn down a unique opportunity, but it also seems like logistically it might be impossible for me to complete. Any help or answers would be appreciated. Thanks!

Remember those good times when JHU announced in June that the fall semester will be hybrid? And when they reverted their decision to make the fall semester hybrid, like literally 2-3 weeks before the semester's start? 

They most likely made the decision to make the fall 2020 semester a hybrid semester looking at the national trend of COVID cases. Up until mid-June, the trend looked pretty promising; the daily new cases of COVID were constantly decreasing and there was a good reason to believe that that will continue, based on the basic principle of extrapolation. However, that quickly turned out to be not accurate, as new cases suddenly began to climb in June and July. The administrators were probably really confused as to what to do about the fall semester after looking at the graph. Although the numbers did start to decrease a little bit around early August, they decided to not take the risk and just revert their decision. 

You all probably got an email on how they want to ensure that undergraduate students will get to register before the thanksgiving break. Traditionally, they released the course offerings for the upcoming semester 2 weeks before the first day of registration, meaning that they most likely will let the undergraduates register on the week of November 16, consequently meaning that they will have to release the course offerings on November 2. So they have only one week left to decide whether the semester is going to be online or offline.

Now, look at the new covid cases graph as of today. 2 days go, the US hit all-time record peak of new COVID cases per day. It would be insane for them to decide that next semester is going to be offline (or hybrid) at least based on the graph. I am like 99% sure that they will post the course offering and put the location of the courses as 'online.' They do not want to take any risks like they did last time. 

But then you may say, ""they might revert their decisions later?"" and although that is a valid claim, I am not entirely sure at this point as of what's going to happen. The vaccine won't solve anything at a rapid rate. The daily cases will be at around 70,000-80,000 range at least for another month probably, and that probably does mean that there will be at least 5 digit numbers of new COVID cases throughout the spring semester, or at least at the start of the spring semester. I don't know if they'd be willing to take that huge risk of possible mass infections, especially looking at what happened at schools such as UNC after they've decided to welcome students on campus. 

Perhaps you disagree with me. Perhaps you want to just grasp on to this last straw of hope. Perhaps you want to deny everything and just think that next semester is going to be offline. Perhaps you think I am overly pessimistic. All are appropriate reactions/responses. But I think all evidence points to the very obvious and clear future: another semester of Zoom University. I really wish I was wrong though. I wish some of you can come back to this post next semester and comment ""Ha! In your face!"" We'll see what happens.

I was recently accepted for the Space Systems Engineering masters at JHU EP. I'm aware that the admissions criteria for the professionals program is comparably lax to the in-person degrees, but I'm still excited to continue my education at this institution.

Has anyone here gone through the program or have some sort of familiarity with it? I can't shake some hesitation towards accepting the offer since there's not much information about the program out there. Is the program well respected? Does JHU have connections with any industry employers? Is a Space Systems Engineering degree too specific compared to a Systems/Aerospace/Mechanical degree? Really, I'd appreciate pretty much any thoughts you guys might have on this topic.

If some context helps, I graduated earlier this year with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and am about 5 months into my first job as an Aerospace Engineer in a space-related sector. I'm really interested in the industry, but I want to make sure that I'm making decisions that are good for my long term career. If the MS Space Systems Engineering isn't likely to afford extra opportunities, then it would probably be a mistake.

Thank you for your time!",Any thoughts about the EP MS Space Systems Engineering program?,t3_jb11ig,7.0,1.0

My name is James, I'm 35 and currently in Rochester, New York. I'm a RIT Graduate; Class of 2016. I was an engineer at NASA and I was also in the U.S. Army. I had to give up my career due to kidney failure. I have Polycystic kidney disease which came from my father.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing asking for help in two areas (Please forgive me as I am not a writer).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a live donor that would be willing to give me a Kidney. I don't drink, smoke or do drugs and I will use that gift to go back to servicing my country/ community. If I can get a kidney soon, I can go back into the Army(I'm an Army Civilian - I'm out on Army disability). I would also go back to working with NASA. I was also accepted into MIT Lincoln Labs and they said I could take MIT classes. So there is a chance I'll just go to MIT LL and work towards a graduate degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to Start home Dialysis but it's complicated. However, my insurance will pay someone to help me setup on home dialysis. They will pay $12.00 per hour and I believe I will need help for about 30 hours a week. To be more honest, I'd say I just need help getting set up on the machine and taken off. You will be trained in a home dialysis center and certified. You have to be used to the sight of blood. You don't have to worry about NEEDLES. I have z port in my chest I hook up to so no needles are required; I hate needles. Just to reiterate, I manly need help hooking up and taken off but should be watched for Low Blood Pressure drops. My blood Pressure can drop to 40/20; One passes out from that low of a pressure. You can you lay me back in my dialysis chair where I am flipped onto my head so the blood can go back to my head. Also, need help with cramping, removing fluids from the blood causes me to cramp in my legs and feet. You'll have to massage them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am registered at John Hopkins for a Transplant but that's only with a dead donor and those kidneys only last \~10 years but if I can find a live donor, the kidney will last 25+ years. I wont get a Kidney from Hopkins until 2025 or so. the list is so LONG. There are so many people on it. Also, I am registered with U of R and saying about 2025-2027 for a dead donor. Both places said if I can find a live donor they will do the transplant ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you may ask what about family donating? Well, My mother tried to donate but they found she has health issues that are stopping her from donating. She has a second Husband that also tried but he also has health Issues. I have a younger sister but she wont' donate. Instead the day she found out I need a kidney, she went to Mexico to get a boob job so she's not donating. Moreover, I am having to take care of my dad who well does not deserve my help at all. He's truly a bad guy; a true definition of a monster. He's done a lot of bad things in life but I need him a live right now. It's something I can't explain over reddit. I just want to say my life is so stressed from the kidney failure, having to give  up my careers and having to help a father who is a monster; No one should have a father like my father. Plus he gave me this disease in the first place; Polycystic Kidney Disease. My family is broken and sad. Also, just found out my mother had a heart attack; I guess the drugs, smoking and alcohol is catching up to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So is there anyone out there willing to help me? I would be very thankful.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I don't really have family here in Rochester. I have a father who moved up here from out of state but he's not mentally there and he has a very troubled past. I can't really get help from him. I do have a few friend here that have been helping me but they have families and lives, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to have a kidney so I can go back to being a productive member of society. I will again go back into the Army. When I was in the Army, I saved a LOT of lives because I have a unique skill set. Also, the Army did look into donating a kidney but because of Army rules and regulations, they can't donate. a Soldier who donates will have to leave the Army. However, the Army did allow me to stay in for 14 additional months while in Kidney failure so I could collect Army benefits. So I am very thankful for the Army for what they did for me. Moreover, I would like to go back into the Army as a Army civilian. The unit I was in was really good to me. Furthermore, I've learned that there is a comradery in serving  and I had the privilege to serve in a company of heroes. I'd like to go back to servicing because those soldiers need all the help they can get right now. I do have a unique skillset that I can use to help save lives.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS; If you want to donate, please call the U of R Kidney Transplant center for more information:

I understand that I need to take 10 courses in total including 2 semester Thesis option but here are my questions: 

1. I work full time and was wondering if I should take one class a semester or 2 a semester is doable?

2. Is it like a full 14 week semester or is it like multiple terms in a semester where I can take 2 diff classes in each term?

3. If it is 1 class per semester and each semester is 14 weeks long then I’ll need 10 semesters to finish my masters? How does that work out since 10 semesters are like 5 years or 3ish including summer.

Dear prospective participant,

We would like you to participate in a research survey that is being led by Clemson University’s Analytics and Data Lab. Our survey gauges college students on their perceptions of individual privacy and privacy of location and space and how it relates to trust when adopting an institution led digitized contact tracing application.

* You need to be an undergraduate college student at a two-year or four-year college in the United States.
* This survey will take 10 to 15 minutes to take.
* At the end of the survey is a sign up for optional follow-up interviews that will be led by students of our Analytics and Data Lab.
* Your survey answers remain anonymous outside of the Analytics and Data Lab and will be used internally by us to create a big picture of college students’ point of view on individual location privacy when it comes to a digitized contact tracing application, something that is extremely important in today’s day and age considering the on-going COVID-19 epidemic.  

   * The only personal identifiable information being collected will be your gender, ethnicity, the college you are currently attending, current class standing, and major.

The survey will open September 1st, 2020, and close October 1st, 2020, or when we reach 200 participants.

Please let us know if you have any questions and again thank you so much.

I am applying to  Johns Hopkins Engineering for Professionals masters programs. I have a bachelor degree in electrical engineering and have been working solely in the IT industry since graduation with 10 years of experience (Software Engineer, QA Engineer, Test Automation, SDET) in various companies such as aerospace, speech recognition, and data analysis. 

I am very interested in data science. But looking at the programs at John Hopkins, there are two I am interested in:

1. Masters of CS specializing in Data Science
2. Masters of Data Science

I have some fundamental understanding of the difference between them. while CS is more theoretical with less emphasis in python, while Masters of Data Science is more practical, and from the course structure, it puts a certain amount of emphasis on math and statistics, and use more python.

I have also read elsewhere that there are also differences after graduation, when you try to apply for a job, that in the industry, at least for now, Masters of CS is more recognizable than Masters of Data Science, as the standard in education in data science is still not 100% set clearly yet. And also a Masters of Computer Science degree seems to be much broader and would open more doors, not just limited to Data Science.

Looking at the course structure, I found both are very interesting, one seems to put more emphasis on software and development, while the other more on mathematics. 

I am wondering if anyone could shed some light on those aspects, and any inputs are greatly appreciated.

I’m surveying prospective graduate programs in English literature, and when I looked at the U.S. News and World Report I saw that JHU was right up there in the rankings. This surprised me, obviously because Johns Hopkins is treated as synonymous with the medical sciences. I’ve looked at the English Department website and perused the graduate courses, and it looks to be a good scene, but I’m very curious to hear what the actual students have to say about the academic material and culture.

1) Using a credit card responsibly to create a credit score. I had no credit score a year ago and opened one that required one of my parents to co-sign due to that lack of credit. The Johns Hopkins Credit Union could be worth looking into, but there's so many banks you can choose based on preferred locations, perks, APR, or what you can get approved for. The benefit of a credit score is it'll help you sign for your own leases later on, you need a long credit history for major purchases (car, house), and it'll allow you to get better credit cards when you graduate to get rewards for traveling (post COVID) or simply better savings. You can open a credit card and spend less than 30% of your balance to create your score. Each month it will rise from 3 main factors: your credit utilization ratio (1% is optimal), increasing your credit length, and paying your bill off on time each month. 
2) Opening a Roth IRA retirement account when you turn 18 (or as close to 18 as possible). I use Vanguard and seriously you don't have to have lots of money to start one. There is NO minimum and the max per year is $6,000. It has incredible compound interest, typically 6% per year, and so you'd have $92,700 (tax free depending on the account you choose) if you invested just $6,000 when you turned 18 and stopped there. There is power in time. Also you can be lazy and have them invest for you and shift the risk ratios over time by choosing one of their retirement funds. If you have an extra $100 or can budget for it, it's a great habit to start in college and locks ""savings"" into  truly being savings.
3) Mint is a great free app to track your $. It can track savings, credit, credit score, investments, and financial goals. 
4) Honey is a free browser extension that auto plugs in coupons on websites for you. Super helpful when we're finally back on campus to order Domino's with friends randomly or in quarantine to just save money on your purchases. 
5) Good YT to watch: Graham Stephan, CNBC Make It Millennial Money (cool tips from people in their 20s at varying incomes)

Also PS only if you're set on buying a computer (or get the JHU grant), buying from the Hopkins store is ~$100 cheaper :)

JHU keeps expanding the definition of what an ‘essential employee’ is to require more people to work on campus (including the library), even though they are still technically in Phase 1 of reopening. Some departments of the library have even been pressured to reopen or stay open since March because the Faculty/Provost is putting pressure on library administration to get books to professors. When the school year restarts, the library will be open to students at 50% capacity, and most staff involved with circulation will be required to be there, with essentially the same amount of PPE you'd find at an urgent care center - plexiglass barriers around the front desk, masks, face shields (though employees might be expected to bring their own masks?). Curbside pickup is being discontinued, and staff is expected to interact with students as they would were the library open ""normally"". 

Since the library is mostly underground and has bad ventilation, and a lot of the employee offices have no windows or ventilation to speak off, this is pretty darn dangerous. Seating has been removed to encourage social distancing, but administration doesn’t seem at all concerned with the staff and students being in this location, touching the books, and potentially spreading Covid-19. There's also been no talk of how to decontaminate the noncirculating textbooks in the library. So like... even more chance of spreading. The discontinuation of curbside pick-up/book drop is dangerous for both students and staff, and considering that all public libraries are still curb-side only, it’s wild to hear along the grapevine that JHU is not only stopping it, but switching to an open library. Staff who don’t want to comply with this are also being told they need doctor's notes to receive work-from-home accommodations. Hmmmmm. Seems bad.

Hi.  I noticed that there's barely a place on this thread (or frankly, on any site) that helps Hopkins victims of sexual violence navigate the OIE process.  I know as a victim myself I had so many questions that no one could answer for me.  And since many of us are going to move to campus soon, I think now would be a good time to post something that can help a lot of (god forbid) future victims in deciding whether they want to report to OIE, and if they do, what that might look like.

Before I begin, let me just say this to victims: I'm sorry.  What happened to you is terrible.  You must be in agony right now.  I wish I could alleviate your pain.  I'm so so sorry.  If you ever need any help, please DM me.

# What are the investigators like?

Experiences with OIE differ from victim to victim.  Perceptions of OIE have historically been largely negative, with some good reason.  But I will say that my experience with OIE was largely positive.  I think it can be difficult to generalize OIE considering there are different investigators, and there have been a lot of structural changes made to OIE in the last four years.  OIE is continuing to undergo some large changes due to the recent Title IX changes.  But in my opinion, it depends on your investigator.  My investigator was amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  He was pretty stoic, which might be something he had to do-- I'd bet he didn't want to show bias.  He was kind, he offered me juice and water, whether I needed to take breaks, and in times where I sorta fucked up (see below) he was compassionate.  In the end, he wrote the investigative report in my favor.  I've heard of other experiences with other investigators, however.  I know of one person who had texts proving their sexual harassment, and the investigator indicated to the victim during the victim's testimony that they did not believe a word out of the perpetrator's mouth.  So investigators might indicate different levels of bias. I know of another who felt her report made her out to be someone she wasn't-- to the best of my recollection, someone who was lying about being assaulted.

# What is the punishment?

OIE does not handle punishments.  They refer the investigative report to a panel composed of 3 people.  One is an attorney of some sort and the other two are trained university representatives.  To my knowledge, the panel rarely disagrees with the OIE report.

Sadly, while my investigative report deemed that my perpetrator was guilty of assault, his punishment was as follows: (1) ""deferred suspension"" which basically means ""if you're found guilty of assault one more time in the next year, then you will be suspended"" and (2) some 90-minute online training.  Yes.  It's pretty disgusting.  So if you're looking to report so you can obtain retribution, I'd say hedge your bets.  But don't quote me on that.  I don't know if my committee just felt that my incident was more \~ambiguous\~ than some pretty explicitly proven assaults, or whether its customary for them to provide this kind of punishment.

# What if I violate the No-Contact Order (NCO)?

So this is some hot flaming tea.  If you're a victim and you're planning to violate the NCO, at least make sure you're not violating it for retaliation.  Got that checked?  Great.  So if you're thinking ""I want to violate the NCO because I really want to gain closure/understand/heal by talking to my perpetrator""....here's likely what will happen.  As long as you can prove and explain that you didn't violate the NCO to retaliate, OIE isn't going to punish you.  I actually did this.  I realized that central to my healing was gaining closure with my perpetrator, so I secretly contacted him, and then.....well then I got his confession.  Oop.  Well anyway then I discovered that my perpetrator, despite delivering a confession, had basically no regrets about what happened, I was like f u c k t h i s s h i t.  So I talked to Alyse Campbell (please go talk to her, she's actually amazing.  She really helped me with this stuff).  And I discovered it would be best to go to OIE, tell them I fucked up and violated the NCO, give them the details about the confession, and be over with it.  My investigator wasn't upset with me (at least he didn't seem like it), he was very kind.  He took the confession into consideration when creating the report.

Okay so I expect some non-victim readers to be a little back-lashy when reading all that.  ""Wait what? She violated the NCO...had she not done that the perpetrator might have not gotten a punishment.  What if all victims just violate NCOs and get confessions?""  Just know that my initial motivation for violating the NCO was to heal from the trauma, not to get a confession and punish him.  Once I finally self-internalized that my perpetrator was completely un-remorseful was when I decided to use their confession to gain retribution.

# I'm not a victim but I've been accused of sexual misconduct.  What do I do?

There's a couple of things you'll need to internalize going forward.

One, even if the incident is something you would categorize as ""grey"" (e.g. ""well they didn't really give a verbal affirmative yes but she wasn't saying no either, and they said they were crying but I never heard them cry because they were crying quietly"" et cetera et cetera), don't start fooling yourself into thinking you're not at fault here.  If you were accused of misconduct, there is ALWAYS something to regret.  Even if the experience was completely consensual and he/she/they still went home crying, you can't tell me with a straight face that there is nothing you would want to improve upon, that you would want to do better next time.  So if you're sitting across from an OIE investigator, my advice is this: figure out your regrets and pour them out.  Tell them what you should've done better.  Show that you're a better person.  Explain why you think you still deserve an education, and why you think you don't.  It's the right thing to do.

Second, don't expect forgiveness.  They don't have to give you any forgiveness.  What you need to focus on going forward is not that your victim thinks you're an okay human, but that you actually are an okay human.  In my personal opinion, what differentiates good and bad men is not that good men never make mistakes (or terrible ones, for that matter), but that good men devote the rest of their lives for making up their mistakes.  They learn, they grow, they regret, and they apologize a thousand times over.

Third, even if you believe you meant no harm, that doesn't mean what happened wasn't assault/harassment/rape.  Most assaults (\~90%) occur by friends and romantic partners, not by psychopathic strangers in scary white vans.  Just because your definition of rape is sensationalized doesn't mean that what your victim experienced wasn't rape.  All you need to make a sexual act misconduct (and necessarily, to make someone feel like shit) is a lack of affirmative consent.

# Conclusion

I hope this helps.  Please DM me if you have any questions.  For all others, please be nice in the comments.  I've posted on here before about sexual violence and found some exquisite trolls.  If you have a legitimate question or confusion, I will answer to the best of my knowledge.  While I am a survivor, I'm also doing academic research on campus sexual assault, and I'm part of several organizations on campus relating to sexual assault advocacy.  I'm no expert, but I'll do my best.  Thanks.

I was just really curious what double majoring looks like on a diploma. I couldn't find a clear answer online so I figured I'd ask here. I don't think Hopkins gives out two degrees... would I just get the diploma/degree of my primary major?
