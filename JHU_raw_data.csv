I'm now considering moving my JHU app to RD, as I would be committed to pay full tuition (70k/year) if accepted to Hopkins with EDII.

However, the Data Science program seems more practical and better suited for the direction that applied math jobs are skewing as Big Data becomes increasingly pervasive.

AMS on the other hand is a tried and true path that has seen thousands of graduates receive their degrees and go on to be highly successful. Though perhaps it lacks more practical skills such as programming that the Data Science degree does a better job of covering.

So as I’m sure many people have noticed, we have very harsh restrictions (no people in your room, no sitting in hallways, no common areas for now, mask mandate when running alone outside, etc). These rules are obviously sparking mental health issues in many freshmen. However, I don’t really want to argue about whether they are fully justified or not right now; I understand that we have a responsibility to protect the Baltimore community. My concern is for later in the semester and looking forward to the fall.

By some point in mid March, a year after all of this really started, the vast majority of healthcare workers and elderly will have had the opportunity to receive the vaccine. This is amazing, because the vaccine so far seems to be 95% effective at preventing illness but 100% effective at preventing hospitalization. Since the vast majority of deaths (I believe 80%+, but correct me if I’m wrong) have occurred in people over the age of 65, this will reduce to death rate to be on par with a seasonal flu. On top of that, overall transmission rates will be cut as we slowly approach the heard immunity threshold.

However, because college aged students are incredibly low risk (I believe that death rate for people under 20 is .003%) we are dead last in line for the vaccine. This makes sense, if we want to reduce deaths then we need to prioritize vaccinating people who actually could die if they catch the virus. HOWEVER, it is not justified, fair, or reasonable for Johns Hopkins, or society as a whole, to continue imposing restrictions on healthy young people when the people we have been protecting for the last year are no longer vulnerable. 

The school has said the restrictions will likely remain in place for the entire semester. This is not based on actual science or data, nor is it good public health policy. Good policy takes into account more than one disease, and at this rate the risk of student suicide is likely much higher than the risk of a student COVID death. We did not have mask mandates, lockdowns, capacity restrictions, etc. for the flu, which is more dangerous to our demographic than COVID is. Therefore, it does not make any sense to continue with restrictions when COVID death rates reach the flu’s (~60k per year).

I am very concerned that the university has dug a hole that will be very difficult to crawl out of without a sensible, set in stone reopening metric. COVID zero, and even full student vaccination, are not reasonable levels to hope for before allowing a semblance of normal. I really hope everyone understands my concern and what I’m trying to say here.",jhu,COVID Restrictions after March,0.0,0.31

I’m a student from Washington University in St. Louis. At WashU, I am a member of a non-profit organization called Heart for the Homeless. One of our projects is to create resource guides which contain low-cost healthcare options and other vital medical information that we share with clinics and the people we meet at homeless shelters. Please check out our website and [success](https://sites.wustl.edu/heartforthehomeless/national-primary-care-resources-project/npcr-project-success-stories/) stories to learn more about this initiative.

If any individuals or student groups at JHU are interested in getting involved in our project, we would love to have you join our team. We have worked with over 30 cities and would work with you every step of the way as you make resource guides for parts of the Baltimore area.

As project lead, I will be able provide you with specific instructions, templates, and other important information that should streamline the process of making a resource guide.  This is a great opportunity for pre-meds (especially during the pandemic), not to mention a great chance to address a pressing societal issue. Please check out our [website](https://sites.wustl.edu/heartforthehomeless/) for more information about Heart for the Homeless. You can also learn more about this project under the “NPCR Project” tab.

The two of us just released the second episode of “15 Minute Papers”. Our goal is to expose people to a broad variety of research fields with digestible glimpses into biomedical publications.

In each of our episodes, we will take you through the background of a specific laboratory, and, within a quick 15 minutes, guide you through a publication with one of the actual authors!

Check out our latest episode where we spoke to a PhD candidate here at JHU about their paper on fate-mapping hypoxic tumor cells to track metastasis.

The Alternative Protein Project is a coalition of engineers, scientists, policy makers, entrepreneurs, writers, and other young professionals who are interested in changing the world of food through alternative proteins. Alternative proteins encompass meat, fish, dairy, and eggs made using plant-based, fermentation-derived, and/or cultivated ingredients that do not require animal agriculture. Objectives for the group include inviting guest speakers to the university, developing an alternative protein curriculum, partnering with industries in this space, discussing literature, supporting related research at JHU, and fostering a supportive environment where students can aid each other in their job quests or related projects.

The Good Food Institute helped launch 5 chapters of the Alternative Protein Project around the world just last year, including at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UNC Chapel Hill, CU Boulder, and Tel Aviv in Israel; I'm hoping Hopkins can be on the list for 2021!

I have seen similar threads, but it seems that people are not representing the MIDS program correctly. Let me know if I have also made any mistakes in my assumptions.

Thanks in advance for your opinion!

**Berkeley: MIDS**

\- Very expensive (roughly $75k).

\- I was told a month ago by a counsellor that the acceptance rate is \~30%.

\- The classes are live (I would enjoy getting to know the other students).

\- Although the program is offered by the School of Information, the program is a STEM designation.

\- Works with ""2U"", but 2U does **NOT** hire the professors. The professors are full time at Berkeley. I believe that 2U simply helps them with administrative tasks and advertising?

\- I believe this program will ""ease"" me into data science more than Johns Hopkins (for example, there is an optional first program in Python).

\- I will study statistics (probably intro to statistics though), data engineering, machine learning, deep learning, time series data, and NLP.

\- Fantastic school for all things computer science related.

&amp;#x200B;

**Johns Hopkins: Artificial Intelligence**

**-** Expensive (roughly $50k).

\- Acceptance rate for Johns Hopkins online courses is high (not sure what percentage).

\- The classes do not require your participation and are not live (nice if you have variable work schedule, but not as great for building a network).

\- I will study Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, AI-enabled systems, Deep Learning, Human Robotics Interaction, NLP, Intelligent Algorithms (fuzzy systems etc), statistics.

\- Doesn't specialize in computer science, but well respected for medicine/bio engineering. Since artificial intelligence leans on human cognition, I would expect them to excel in a curriculum built for artificial intelligence?

It seems like the Johns Hopkins program covers what MIDS covers plus more. In general, I understand that artificial intelligence is within the field of data science, so perhaps the Johns Hopkins program is attempting to be more specialized.

I'm an engineer, I work with inferential models, robotics (slightly), and data wrangling, so both programs are analogous to my work. I believe I would enjoy the Johns Hopkins curriculum more. However, although Johns Hopkins is a fantastic school (and perhaps generally ""rated"" higher than Berkeley), Berkeley is higher ranked in computer science.

\- Regarding the Spring session, I am curious, The JHU decision makers seem to be waiting for some direction. Who is deciding and why the delay i.e, is it some direction from the federal government or the CDC.

Would appreciate if one of the senior students could help out with a few operational questions ( we haven't been to Baltimore and have no idea of the area around JHU).

\- Are parents allowed to use the JHU shuttle (especially during move in)

\- What is the time for the shuttle to complete one cycle (just trying to figure out how slow or fast it is ) and does it wait at a stop for 2-3 minutes or it doesn't stop if no one waves her/his hand at the stop.

\- How easy or difficult is it to find car parking in and around the residence halls (to help with move ins).

\- Are there any unsafe areas around JHU which have to be avoided from a taking Airbnb/strolling around late in the evening perspective.

Appreciate your guidance.

For some background information, I was in a writing-intensive class comprised of about 9 students. With special family circumstances, I was permitted extensions both for three mini essays that had been due throughout the semester, and my final essay. For the mini essays, I submitted them right at the start of the finals period, and my final essay I submitted on Christmas Eve (the original deadline had been a few days previous).

However, since my final essay *was* technically turned in more than 48 hours after the final exam was due, and my professor has not responded or acknowledged the submission of my final exam officially (like she did with my mini essays),  I guess I am a little apprehensive or curious about this lack of a grade. However, since I did have permission for the extension, and it seems based on the subreddit that the 48-hour grading deadline is more a guideline than a rule,  I may be overthinking it.

Obviously, essays take some time to grade, and the holidays just wrapped up, so I'm not trying to be impatient, especially considering my professor was seriously generous for working with me and taking into consideration my home circumstances. However, I am getting a bit antsy considering it is now the 4th of January, and there is a bit of ambiguity left in our communications.

The obvious solution would seem to email her, but as someone who already feels like they've been a burden, how do I do so without sounding impatient or bothersome? Should I give her another day or two? Am I worrying over nothing, or should I be worried because this situation is unusual? If anyone has any suggestions or experiences, please feel free to share! 

I know this may seem a bit silly to post about, but I just mostly want to know if I'm alone in waiting on a grade and if anyone has handled things like this in the past. I want to tread carefully with someone who's already made exceptions for me, that's all.",jhu,Still waiting on a grade from one of my professors...,10.0,1.0

I guess it's just really starting to hit me that I haven't really had my freshman year, and that I quite possibly never will. I admit it possibly a little bit of jealousy. Sometimes I just think about how I might start my first semester on campus as a sophomore, watching all the freshmen experience the hype of their first year and missing out on all that first year free food and first year events and orientation fun, (which I know is awkward for some people, but new people and all the new stuff can be pretty fun). Then I start to lowkey think about how Hopkins might forget about how much the '24s don't know Hopkins and we'll never get a real orientation and introduction to Hop and stuff. Realistically, this is just a long thought spiral, not a real worry I know I'm just self-indulging in my pity a little too much.

Honestly, when I take the time to step back from it, I'm well aware it's not the end of the world, and again I do *not* want any '25s feeling unwelcome, I am,  very excited for y'all to join us.

I just want to talk it out with other '24s, and I don't fully feel comfortable reaching out to any '24s that i know right now.

Maybe that's true, but I'd like to get sick of campus first before I decide that. I don't think they meant to be rude but it's just made me so upset when I think about it.

My mom is the same. The first thing she said when my graduation was cancelled and that I might not go to campus, she was like ""Oh whatever, it's not the end of the world/it could be worse."" I honestly am not even upset about missing my graduation, but it's so frustrating that apparently nothing that I was supposed to have matters. I know she kinda regrets it lowkey but honestly it's still in my head and I just don't have anyone else to vent to about this stuff because most of my friends actually ended up being on campus at their schools.

It's really frustrating to hear and I don't want to blow up at anyone so I figured I'd just get this all out in a subreddit post before I waste my time in an frustration/self-pity spiral.

* Is the ""stress culture"" a significant part of student life? From what I've heard, schoolwork can regularly take up to 14-18 hours per day, and while I'm obviously going to college with the expectation that I'm there to study, that sounds a little insane outside of a few days/short periods per semester
* Are there things to do outdoors (hiking, biking, skiing, fishing, etc) within a reasonable distance of the city and in financial reach of a broke college student?
* I've heard from admissions presentations that it's easy enough to study or double major across fields (in my case, engineering and international relations), but I was wondering what the student perspective was on double-majoring
* As I understand it, Hopkins is similar to most schools in that social life revolves around frat parties. Is it easy to find somewhere to be on a Friday night, or are those communities pretty insular? Realistically, do students even have time to leave the library for more than an hour at a time?
* Lastly, does campus feel like a tight community, or more like a loose group of people the same age that happen to be in the same place? I'm sorry I can't phrase that better, but I've heard that there isn't a strong sense of community or ""school spirit"" from students.

I’m aware of what has gone on here in the last few weeks and why you all feel so strongly about Dr. Wierman. I agree how he handled the semester was not the best. However, I feel like the subreddit and for the most part, the student body has taken this outrage way too far.

This semester has been an unprecedented one for all of us, especially due to COVID. This has forced us to change a lot about our traditional learning methods.  I think that in our frustration towards digital learning, we’re forgetting about the struggle that our professors have to deal with. Now, they all have to transfer their in-person curriculums into virtual ones. Not only is this a hard task for anyone, but it is extremely difficult for someone who isn’t as familiar with technology as our generation. And honestly, I’m quite happy with how Dr. Wierman was able to adapt his course to an online setting given these circumstances. He was considerate and open-minded about the tolls of virtual learning, even going as far as getting rid of all tests and quizzes.

Dr. Wierman was also forced to deflate grades in order to fix the flawed grading distribution for the roughly first half of the semester.  Around 80% of the class had at least an A-. I know we all want good grades, but it is an unrealistic expectation to have that distribution remain unchanged by the end of the class. Even now, you’re all expecting to hear that Dr. Wierman became a tyrant, failing everybody and causing mass pandemonium. That couldn’t be farther from the truth! In the last time that he shared grade distributions with the class, over half of students still had at least an A-, and 86% had at least a B-. Only 1 student had a failing grade.

Grades aside, Dr. Wierman had to be very concerned about the integrity of the class given the online modality, and thus, forced him to take all accusations seriously. This includes the textbook incident earlier in the semester, in which a group of students used the answer key to the textbook to gain an unfair advantage in the class over my peers. This outrages me that fellow students would try to do this knowing they are taking advantage of the system and is 100% unsustainable. Relating to the tutoring incident, I think that Wierman was right to look deeper into the situation. Now, I was uninvolved with the group chat and the finer details of the situation, but my gist of it is that a student was giving help despite Wierman telling the class that providing such help would be inappropriate. JHU is a prestigious institution lauded for its rigor and quality of education. To see my fellow classmates try to undermine this aspect of what makes our school so special makes me extremely upset. Reading more about the situation, I agree that the situation was handled quite poorly, but I still stand by the idea that it was conducted with good intentions.

To close it all off, I just want everyone who thinks they have a good understanding of the situation to reflect on what happened. A lot of the Fall 2020 Intro Prob class was lackluster, but a lot of the hate surrounding the class is/was unwarranted and overblown.",jhu,INTRO PROB: In Defense of Dr. Wierman,0.0,0.37

So this survey blew up.  So far, I've gotten about 50 responses with 8 people having matches.  This number could be higher if people took this into consideration:

1. **People who provide a lot of detail are a lot more likely to find a match.**  If you're interested in making a submission, please provide a comfortable amount of detail.  I've deleted submissions that are overly broad since I know I won't be able to match you with anyone.
2. **When I set up matches, I prioritize values over interests.**  For instance, I don't set people up who have different religions or political views unless they expressly state they are open to other political views.  **It will be easier for me to find a match for you if you prioritize talking about your values.**
3. If you provide a height preference, please know that most people don't provide their own height information so I might pair you up with someone who doesn't meet your height preference.  This goes for appearance and athleticism too.  Some people have said they prefer people with certain types of hair or skin tones but not everyone provides a photo of themself in their submission. Some people say they want a dude who is athletic but only a couple dudes provide information about how frequently they work out or how invested they are in sports.  This also goes for responses like ""he must give me space"" or ""they must be socially aware"", since I can't predict that through a survey.
4. Y'all are funny with your potato &amp; salad jokes lol
5. If you want to find a match then the best you can do for yourself is spread the word about the survey!  **Heterosexual men are underrepresented in this survey lol**

1606980320.0,0.0,17.0,"Hello to everyone ""on the other side of the gap""! I'm currently a high school senior from Florida with a considerable interest in Hopkins, and so I figured I'd interrupt the regular talk about your classes and such to ask a couple of questions.

First, I'd like to say that I visited Hopkins a couple of years ago (before the end times) as part of the summer immersion program, and I absolutely fell in love with its campus and culture. I know I only saw a ""PG"" version of it, but still. Baltimore is a beautiful city with beautiful crab cakes— I mean history.

Anyway, gushing aside, I have a couple of questions on admissions for you veterans of the process. Having decided that Regular Decision would be my best bet, I went ahead and submitted as much as I could bright and early so I wouldn't have to worry about missing anything later. Still, on the admissions portal, it says I'm missing an ""AP Score report"", and therein lies the problem.

I'd like to think I have fairly competitive stats in most respects (5s, a couple 4s, 1550 SAT, decent GPA, etc), except for one pesky quarantine AP Test that I may or may not have completely failed. Now, this isn't a ""chance me"" post (my nerves are already wracked as it is, I don't need internet strangers telling me I won't make it to this or that college), but I'd like to ask if AP Score reports are to be turned in as part of the admissions process. I did self-report my scores (all except the mentioned ""icky score"") on the common app, but I'm not sure if I am now required to submit my official scores.

Aside from that clarification, I guess I'd also like to ask for advice on dealing with the application process. This need not be only related to Hopkins— I just wanted to ask how you all dealt with the anxiety of waiting for your college admissions results.

To all of you who have made it, warm greetings from Florida. It is now 2:20 AM and my college admissions anxiety has no signs of stopping, but at the very least I hope this post will help a hopeful like me in the process.",jhu,Hello JHU Students! A few questions from a high school senior,17.0,1.0

If you fill out the survey, I'll use your results to create a match based on other responses.  I'll select a match based on characteristics you desire in a partner.  I won't reach out to you if I don't think you have a good enough match.  But if you have a match, I'll reach out to you and your match and provide your survey responses to each other.  If you're both interested in meeting, I'll put you in touch.  In the meantime, spread the word, since the more people fill out this survey, the more likely they'll find someone on campus who meets their interests.

This survey isn't entirely anonymous.  For one, if you like, you can provide a photo of yourself.  But you're required to provide some sort of contact information (email, social media link, etc) so that we can reach out to you once we get a match.  We won't use the email/social media you provide for any purposes other than reaching out to you (we don't have a use for it anyways lol).  **If you're paranoid about sharing your information, then you should only provide responses you would be comfortable with the whole world seeing.**  Otherwise, make sure you're as specific and as detailed as possible to make sure you get an optimal pick.

Once about 50 people take the survey, I'll start contacting people with their matches.  **I'll routinely update this post with the number of people who have taken the survey.**  Cheers!

Well.. Hear me out. I am a new transfer student doing AMS major, and I feel depressed, lonely, and dumb. I transferred from a community college.. and I cannot keep up with my classes. I just can’t. I don’t have enough foundational knowledge I guess.. it’s above my mental abilities. Kids around me are very smart and bright, and it is an honor to be around such brilliant people. However, I am failing.. 😔 I barely get any sleep and food. I came with intention of being a premed, but now the only thing I can hope for is that I graduate with a bare minimum gpa like 2.5. Came here with a dream of becoming a neurosurgeon, and now all I have is ruined mental health and student loans. I feel stuck and hopeless. I don’t know what I should do.. change majors, goals, get a new brain, reality check... 😞 Thank you for reading, I guess it’s just a rant.

1605380288.0,0.0,180.0,"Hi yall,

I know you guys have probably seen this 1000 times now, but this is yet another Intro to Probability post. I’m the freshman that was accused of academic dishonesty, and tldr is that the meeting between Dr. Wierman and the Ethics Board member didn’t seem to go very well, as I didn’t feel I couldn’t effectively get my point across and have him understand my stance on the issue. The report apparently claimed I was freely handing out answers to homework and illegally assisting students, which is not the case. I think this was reflected in the punishment within settlement document that he proposed that I don’t think I want to accept tbh. However, I am not fully decided on what to do. The description of the actions is described in other posts, so I wont delve in there, but I truly don’t feel I violated ethics guidelines. Thus, I have a few questions regarding settlements vs board meetings. For general background info, this is my first academic ethics offense.

1: If I accept the settlement, how does it appear on my transcript/academic record? I don’t think I could accept this proposal if it appears there, as that strongly hurts my integrity

2: How often do board meetings really overturn the decision/go in favor of the student? I’m worried about this especially the work that would need to go into it, and I don’t want it to be for nothing

3: If I am convicted at the board meeting, does that appear any differently anywhere than if I accept the settlement and it appearing in my record?

4: Is there anything I can do regarding the professor violating my rights/not following proper procedure? Short of it is that it appears he talked to another professor about this situation before the meeting yesterday looking for guidance on how to punish me, and it appears the word “freshman” was used in the description, of which there are only 2 of us, which means it’s easily traceable back to me. Whoever he discussed with advised I should be expelled, which I don’t think is reasonable at all. Additionally, it states in the ethics process that the professor should promptly discuss with the student the concern before the ethics board, in which this did not occur, nor was the discussion prompt after the event, as it appears the complaint was received on October 30, and this is 2 weeks later now.

5: Is illegally obtained evidence admissible in an ethics board meeting? Florida (where I reside) and Maryland are both 2-way consent states, meaning that someone turning in screenshots to the professor would have needed consent from myself to screenshot in the first place, which I explicitly said at the beginning I was not comfortable with, especially because it had my face in it. 

6: Similarly to an earlier question, if I am off the hook after the ethics board meeting, how does this appear, if at all?

7: For anyone that has had an ethics board meeting before, any advice that you would give or any information I should know beforehand that I didn’t ask above?

Thank you so much in advance for any thoughts or input on any of these :) I’m pretty saddened by this scenario that I have to deal with, but I appreciate the huge amount of support from everyone inside and outside of this class.",jhu,Academic Ethics Questions,180.0,1.0
1605345005.0,0.0,153.0,"I'm sure many of you already know about the group chat incident. It's absurd that Wierman would even consider it academic dishonesty. As far as I know, no one was cheating or copying answers or anything of the sort. It consisted of things we would do in a normal in-person semester - studying together, working together, peer tutoring, etc. and I don't know why Wierman is so stuck up about it. It's ridiculous that he thinks he can prevent students from discussing homework. It's just homework, not a midterm or a final or an exam of any kind.

Between the BS grading, the constantly changing policies, the utter contempt Wierman has for students, and the lack of actual teaching, I'm not sure what exactly is going on anymore. The essays he posts on Blackboard responding to our complaints are so passive aggressive I don't even know what to make of them, and they purposely misrepresent what most students are complaining about. And it feels like each time Wierman does address our concerns, it's some form of malicious compliance. Did anyone notice how difficult the homework for Friday was? Less problems for sure, but the difficulty was much harder than past homework assignments. It's clear he wants us to fail for the sake of his grade distribution.

What really pisses me off though is that a freshman is at risk of being expelled simply for helping students when the instructor and TA's wouldn't. And what sickens me is that another student reported the incident - a student that presumably benefited from the group chat and the zoom study sessions as much as everyone else. JHU already has a reputation for being cutthroat and full of snakes, and I'm angry that this student would try so hard to live up to this stereotype. To make matters worse, it seems like Wierman is trying to figure out who else was in the group chat and zoom calls to punish them as well. The group was one of the few places where I actually felt like I had support in the class. Despite all the BS we had to go through, at least we had each other to turn to. It was literally the only resource students had to get help because of Wierman's unreasonable policies. Now a freshman may have a stain on his record for the rest of his academic career and everyone who was in the chat is at risk of an academic dishonesty violation for simply helping each other and working together to get through this atrocious excuse of a class.

I know this has been said over and over and over again, but please email Dr. Santosa. If you already emailed him before, email him again about this new incident. If you need the email template, message me. Ask for the freshman to not get in trouble, ask for Dr. Santosa to mediate a meeting between the students and Wierman, and emphasize how toxic and cutthroat this class has become. We might not have a group chat anymore, but at the very least we can all pressure the AMS department into ensuring that something like this never happens again.

* He has never answered an email about questions about class.

However, I just wanted to get a pulse check, to see what everyone else is planning for next semester, because I am feeling rather unsure and alone.

Normally, I would love to go back to campus. I miss that place like crazy, especially as a sophomore who barely got to experience time there at all.

Also, I have an ailing grandmother at home that may pass while I'm away, so I think I'd rather stay home an extra semester to be close to her. And, there's the plus of not having to pay for housing.

Anyway, I would feel confident in my decision to stay home, as it seems to work out better for me in terms of safety, family, and financial situation; however, I don't really have an idea how this hybrid scenario is going to play out, and can't help feeling students who stay home are going to get the short end of the stick here.

1604564616.0,0.0,4.0,"So I’m currently a sophomore and just got into a co-op program with an organization in Maryland near Hopkins. I’m really interested in it, but the logistics of the program may prove to be more trouble than it’s worth.

For one, the program is designed such that you work full-time for one semester, and then you return back to school full-time for one semester. So my first question would be: does Hop allow for this sort of staggered leave of absence schedule, or are you limited in how much time you can take off? 

You have to work for a total of 52 weeks to finish the co-op program, so if I’m calculating this correctly, I would have to do at least 3 semesters of work (which means I graduate a year and a half later) plus a summer there. That leads to my second question: would I lose out on financial aid if I took too long to graduate, or would the financial aid still carry over as long as I haven’t finished my degree? I get most of my aid from institutional grants, so it does concern me a little. 

My third question has to do with housing. The work location is really close proximity to Hopkins, so my thought was that I could just commute from my apartment, but then I realized I would be on leave of absence during this time. Would Hopkins student-designated apartments still be available to me while I’m working, or would I have to find my own housing since I’m no longer a student during that period? 

Sorry for all the questions, I know it’s a lot, but I’m just super nervous because I only have 2 weeks to respond to the employer and I want to figure out everything before I make a decision.

Remember those good times when JHU announced in June that the fall semester will be hybrid? And when they reverted their decision to make the fall semester hybrid, like literally 2-3 weeks before the semester's start? 

They most likely made the decision to make the fall 2020 semester a hybrid semester looking at the national trend of COVID cases. Up until mid-June, the trend looked pretty promising; the daily new cases of COVID were constantly decreasing and there was a good reason to believe that that will continue, based on the basic principle of extrapolation. However, that quickly turned out to be not accurate, as new cases suddenly began to climb in June and July. The administrators were probably really confused as to what to do about the fall semester after looking at the graph. Although the numbers did start to decrease a little bit around early August, they decided to not take the risk and just revert their decision. 

You all probably got an email on how they want to ensure that undergraduate students will get to register before the thanksgiving break. Traditionally, they released the course offerings for the upcoming semester 2 weeks before the first day of registration, meaning that they most likely will let the undergraduates register on the week of November 16, consequently meaning that they will have to release the course offerings on November 2. So they have only one week left to decide whether the semester is going to be online or offline.

Now, look at the new covid cases graph as of today. 2 days go, the US hit all-time record peak of new COVID cases per day. It would be insane for them to decide that next semester is going to be offline (or hybrid) at least based on the graph. I am like 99% sure that they will post the course offering and put the location of the courses as 'online.' They do not want to take any risks like they did last time. 

But then you may say, ""they might revert their decisions later?"" and although that is a valid claim, I am not entirely sure at this point as of what's going to happen. The vaccine won't solve anything at a rapid rate. The daily cases will be at around 70,000-80,000 range at least for another month probably, and that probably does mean that there will be at least 5 digit numbers of new COVID cases throughout the spring semester, or at least at the start of the spring semester. I don't know if they'd be willing to take that huge risk of possible mass infections, especially looking at what happened at schools such as UNC after they've decided to welcome students on campus. 

Perhaps you disagree with me. Perhaps you want to just grasp on to this last straw of hope. Perhaps you want to deny everything and just think that next semester is going to be offline. Perhaps you think I am overly pessimistic. All are appropriate reactions/responses. But I think all evidence points to the very obvious and clear future: another semester of Zoom University. I really wish I was wrong though. I wish some of you can come back to this post next semester and comment ""Ha! In your face!"" We'll see what happens.

 Also, in general, is it true that you don't have to spend any time in a major before you can switch it?

I was recently accepted for the Space Systems Engineering masters at JHU EP. I'm aware that the admissions criteria for the professionals program is comparably lax to the in-person degrees, but I'm still excited to continue my education at this institution.

Has anyone here gone through the program or have some sort of familiarity with it? I can't shake some hesitation towards accepting the offer since there's not much information about the program out there. Is the program well respected? Does JHU have connections with any industry employers? Is a Space Systems Engineering degree too specific compared to a Systems/Aerospace/Mechanical degree? Really, I'd appreciate pretty much any thoughts you guys might have on this topic.

If some context helps, I graduated earlier this year with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and am about 5 months into my first job as an Aerospace Engineer in a space-related sector. I'm really interested in the industry, but I want to make sure that I'm making decisions that are good for my long term career. If the MS Space Systems Engineering isn't likely to afford extra opportunities, then it would probably be a mistake.

1602676758.0,0.0,83.0,"Hello Reddit,

My name is James, I'm 35 and currently in Rochester, New York. I'm a RIT Graduate; Class of 2016. I was an engineer at NASA and I was also in the U.S. Army. I had to give up my career due to kidney failure. I have Polycystic kidney disease which came from my father.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing asking for help in two areas (Please forgive me as I am not a writer).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a live donor that would be willing to give me a Kidney. I don't drink, smoke or do drugs and I will use that gift to go back to servicing my country/ community. If I can get a kidney soon, I can go back into the Army(I'm an Army Civilian - I'm out on Army disability). I would also go back to working with NASA. I was also accepted into MIT Lincoln Labs and they said I could take MIT classes. So there is a chance I'll just go to MIT LL and work towards a graduate degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to Start home Dialysis but it's complicated. However, my insurance will pay someone to help me setup on home dialysis. They will pay $12.00 per hour and I believe I will need help for about 30 hours a week. To be more honest, I'd say I just need help getting set up on the machine and taken off. You will be trained in a home dialysis center and certified. You have to be used to the sight of blood. You don't have to worry about NEEDLES. I have z port in my chest I hook up to so no needles are required; I hate needles. Just to reiterate, I manly need help hooking up and taken off but should be watched for Low Blood Pressure drops. My blood Pressure can drop to 40/20; One passes out from that low of a pressure. You can you lay me back in my dialysis chair where I am flipped onto my head so the blood can go back to my head. Also, need help with cramping, removing fluids from the blood causes me to cramp in my legs and feet. You'll have to massage them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am registered at John Hopkins for a Transplant but that's only with a dead donor and those kidneys only last \~10 years but if I can find a live donor, the kidney will last 25+ years. I wont get a Kidney from Hopkins until 2025 or so. the list is so LONG. There are so many people on it. Also, I am registered with U of R and saying about 2025-2027 for a dead donor. Both places said if I can find a live donor they will do the transplant ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you may ask what about family donating? Well, My mother tried to donate but they found she has health issues that are stopping her from donating. She has a second Husband that also tried but he also has health Issues. I have a younger sister but she wont' donate. Instead the day she found out I need a kidney, she went to Mexico to get a boob job so she's not donating. Moreover, I am having to take care of my dad who well does not deserve my help at all. He's truly a bad guy; a true definition of a monster. He's done a lot of bad things in life but I need him a live right now. It's something I can't explain over reddit. I just want to say my life is so stressed from the kidney failure, having to give  up my careers and having to help a father who is a monster; No one should have a father like my father. Plus he gave me this disease in the first place; Polycystic Kidney Disease. My family is broken and sad. Also, just found out my mother had a heart attack; I guess the drugs, smoking and alcohol is catching up to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So is there anyone out there willing to help me? I would be very thankful.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I don't really have family here in Rochester. I have a father who moved up here from out of state but he's not mentally there and he has a very troubled past. I can't really get help from him. I do have a few friend here that have been helping me but they have families and lives, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to have a kidney so I can go back to being a productive member of society. I will again go back into the Army. When I was in the Army, I saved a LOT of lives because I have a unique skill set. Also, the Army did look into donating a kidney but because of Army rules and regulations, they can't donate. a Soldier who donates will have to leave the Army. However, the Army did allow me to stay in for 14 additional months while in Kidney failure so I could collect Army benefits. So I am very thankful for the Army for what they did for me. Moreover, I would like to go back into the Army as a Army civilian. The unit I was in was really good to me. Furthermore, I've learned that there is a comradery in serving  and I had the privilege to serve in a company of heroes. I'd like to go back to servicing because those soldiers need all the help they can get right now. I do have a unique skillset that I can use to help save lives.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS; If you want to donate, please call the U of R Kidney Transplant center for more information:

Dear prospective participant,

We would like you to participate in a research survey that is being led by Clemson University’s Analytics and Data Lab. Our survey gauges college students on their perceptions of individual privacy and privacy of location and space and how it relates to trust when adopting an institution led digitized contact tracing application.

* You need to be an undergraduate college student at a two-year or four-year college in the United States.
* This survey will take 10 to 15 minutes to take.
* At the end of the survey is a sign up for optional follow-up interviews that will be led by students of our Analytics and Data Lab.
* Your survey answers remain anonymous outside of the Analytics and Data Lab and will be used internally by us to create a big picture of college students’ point of view on individual location privacy when it comes to a digitized contact tracing application, something that is extremely important in today’s day and age considering the on-going COVID-19 epidemic.  

   * The only personal identifiable information being collected will be your gender, ethnicity, the college you are currently attending, current class standing, and major.

The survey will open September 1st, 2020, and close October 1st, 2020, or when we reach 200 participants.

Please let us know if you have any questions and again thank you so much.

I am applying to  Johns Hopkins Engineering for Professionals masters programs. I have a bachelor degree in electrical engineering and have been working solely in the IT industry since graduation with 10 years of experience (Software Engineer, QA Engineer, Test Automation, SDET) in various companies such as aerospace, speech recognition, and data analysis. 

I am very interested in data science. But looking at the programs at John Hopkins, there are two I am interested in:

1. Masters of CS specializing in Data Science
2. Masters of Data Science

I have some fundamental understanding of the difference between them. while CS is more theoretical with less emphasis in python, while Masters of Data Science is more practical, and from the course structure, it puts a certain amount of emphasis on math and statistics, and use more python.

I have also read elsewhere that there are also differences after graduation, when you try to apply for a job, that in the industry, at least for now, Masters of CS is more recognizable than Masters of Data Science, as the standard in education in data science is still not 100% set clearly yet. And also a Masters of Computer Science degree seems to be much broader and would open more doors, not just limited to Data Science.

Looking at the course structure, I found both are very interesting, one seems to put more emphasis on software and development, while the other more on mathematics. 

I am wondering if anyone could shed some light on those aspects, and any inputs are greatly appreciated.

I’m surveying prospective graduate programs in English literature, and when I looked at the U.S. News and World Report I saw that JHU was right up there in the rankings. This surprised me, obviously because Johns Hopkins is treated as synonymous with the medical sciences. I’ve looked at the English Department website and perused the graduate courses, and it looks to be a good scene, but I’m very curious to hear what the actual students have to say about the academic material and culture. I am especially interested in the perspective of humanities graduate students, but I welcome undergraduate perspectives.

I have a few neuroscience and behavioral bio courses already, so its not like I have 0 bio courses other than Gen Bio from Freshman year.

1) Using a credit card responsibly to create a credit score. I had no credit score a year ago and opened one that required one of my parents to co-sign due to that lack of credit. The Johns Hopkins Credit Union could be worth looking into, but there's so many banks you can choose based on preferred locations, perks, APR, or what you can get approved for. The benefit of a credit score is it'll help you sign for your own leases later on, you need a long credit history for major purchases (car, house), and it'll allow you to get better credit cards when you graduate to get rewards for traveling (post COVID) or simply better savings. You can open a credit card and spend less than 30% of your balance to create your score. Each month it will rise from 3 main factors: your credit utilization ratio (1% is optimal), increasing your credit length, and paying your bill off on time each month. 
2) Opening a Roth IRA retirement account when you turn 18 (or as close to 18 as possible). I use Vanguard and seriously you don't have to have lots of money to start one. There is NO minimum and the max per year is $6,000. It has incredible compound interest, typically 6% per year, and so you'd have $92,700 (tax free depending on the account you choose) if you invested just $6,000 when you turned 18 and stopped there. There is power in time. Also you can be lazy and have them invest for you and shift the risk ratios over time by choosing one of their retirement funds. If you have an extra $100 or can budget for it, it's a great habit to start in college and locks ""savings"" into  truly being savings.
3) Mint is a great free app to track your $. It can track savings, credit, credit score, investments, and financial goals. 
4) Honey is a free browser extension that auto plugs in coupons on websites for you. Super helpful when we're finally back on campus to order Domino's with friends randomly or in quarantine to just save money on your purchases. 
5) Good YT to watch: Graham Stephan, CNBC Make It Millennial Money (cool tips from people in their 20s at varying incomes)

Also PS only if you're set on buying a computer (or get the JHU grant), buying from the Hopkins store is ~$100 cheaper :)

JHU keeps expanding the definition of what an ‘essential employee’ is to require more people to work on campus (including the library), even though they are still technically in Phase 1 of reopening. Some departments of the library have even been pressured to reopen or stay open since March because the Faculty/Provost is putting pressure on library administration to get books to professors. When the school year restarts, the library will be open to students at 50% capacity, and most staff involved with circulation will be required to be there, with essentially the same amount of PPE you'd find at an urgent care center - plexiglass barriers around the front desk, masks, face shields (though employees might be expected to bring their own masks?). Curbside pickup is being discontinued, and staff is expected to interact with students as they would were the library open ""normally"". 

Since the library is mostly underground and has bad ventilation, and a lot of the employee offices have no windows or ventilation to speak off, this is pretty darn dangerous. Seating has been removed to encourage social distancing, but administration doesn’t seem at all concerned with the staff and students being in this location, touching the books, and potentially spreading Covid-19. There's also been no talk of how to decontaminate the noncirculating textbooks in the library. So like... even more chance of spreading. The discontinuation of curbside pick-up/book drop is dangerous for both students and staff, and considering that all public libraries are still curb-side only, it’s wild to hear along the grapevine that JHU is not only stopping it, but switching to an open library. Staff who don’t want to comply with this are also being told they need doctor's notes to receive work-from-home accommodations. Hmmmmm. Seems bad.

I sent an application for a financial appeal a few days ago but haven’t received a response yet. My FAFSA EFC only went up by $2000 but JHU increased my EFC by ~$10000. Furthermore, my fin aid adviser has been impossible to reach during the past week.

Personally, after all the delays and issues that have occurred during the pandemic (including the email that basically told students that the school will have a $350 million deficit in the coming year)I’m getting worried that JHU might be significantly reducing the amount of aid they will give to students.

Hi.  I noticed that there's barely a place on this thread (or frankly, on any site) that helps Hopkins victims of sexual violence navigate the OIE process.  I know as a victim myself I had so many questions that no one could answer for me.  And since many of us are going to move to campus soon, I think now would be a good time to post something that can help a lot of (god forbid) future victims in deciding whether they want to report to OIE, and if they do, what that might look like.

Before I begin, let me just say this to victims: I'm sorry.  What happened to you is terrible.  You must be in agony right now.  I wish I could alleviate your pain.  I'm so so sorry.  If you ever need any help, please DM me.

# What are the investigators like?

Experiences with OIE differ from victim to victim.  Perceptions of OIE have historically been largely negative, with some good reason.  But I will say that my experience with OIE was largely positive.  I think it can be difficult to generalize OIE considering there are different investigators, and there have been a lot of structural changes made to OIE in the last four years.  OIE is continuing to undergo some large changes due to the recent Title IX changes.  But in my opinion, it depends on your investigator.  My investigator was amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  He was pretty stoic, which might be something he had to do-- I'd bet he didn't want to show bias.  He was kind, he offered me juice and water, whether I needed to take breaks, and in times where I sorta fucked up (see below) he was compassionate.  In the end, he wrote the investigative report in my favor.  I've heard of other experiences with other investigators, however.  I know of one person who had texts proving their sexual harassment, and the investigator indicated to the victim during the victim's testimony that they did not believe a word out of the perpetrator's mouth.  So investigators might indicate different levels of bias. I know of another who felt her report made her out to be someone she wasn't-- to the best of my recollection, someone who was lying about being assaulted.

# What is the punishment?

OIE does not handle punishments.  They refer the investigative report to a panel composed of 3 people.  One is an attorney of some sort and the other two are trained university representatives.  To my knowledge, the panel rarely disagrees with the OIE report.

Sadly, while my investigative report deemed that my perpetrator was guilty of assault, his punishment was as follows: (1) ""deferred suspension"" which basically means ""if you're found guilty of assault one more time in the next year, then you will be suspended"" and (2) some 90-minute online training.  Yes.  It's pretty disgusting.  So if you're looking to report so you can obtain retribution, I'd say hedge your bets.  But don't quote me on that.  I don't know if my committee just felt that my incident was more \~ambiguous\~ than some pretty explicitly proven assaults, or whether its customary for them to provide this kind of punishment.

# What if I violate the No-Contact Order (NCO)?

So this is some hot flaming tea.  If you're a victim and you're planning to violate the NCO, at least make sure you're not violating it for retaliation.  Got that checked?  Great.  So if you're thinking ""I want to violate the NCO because I really want to gain closure/understand/heal by talking to my perpetrator""....here's likely what will happen.  As long as you can prove and explain that you didn't violate the NCO to retaliate, OIE isn't going to punish you.  I actually did this.  I realized that central to my healing was gaining closure with my perpetrator, so I secretly contacted him, and then.....well then I got his confession.  Oop.  Well anyway then I discovered that my perpetrator, despite delivering a confession, had basically no regrets about what happened, I was like f u c k t h i s s h i t.  So I talked to Alyse Campbell (please go talk to her, she's actually amazing.  She really helped me with this stuff).  And I discovered it would be best to go to OIE, tell them I fucked up and violated the NCO, give them the details about the confession, and be over with it.  My investigator wasn't upset with me (at least he didn't seem like it), he was very kind.  He took the confession into consideration when creating the report.

Okay so I expect some non-victim readers to be a little back-lashy when reading all that.  ""Wait what? She violated the NCO...had she not done that the perpetrator might have not gotten a punishment.  What if all victims just violate NCOs and get confessions?""  Just know that my initial motivation for violating the NCO was to heal from the trauma, not to get a confession and punish him.  Once I finally self-internalized that my perpetrator was completely un-remorseful was when I decided to use their confession to gain retribution.

# I'm not a victim but I've been accused of sexual misconduct.  What do I do?

There's a couple of things you'll need to internalize going forward.

One, even if the incident is something you would categorize as ""grey"" (e.g. ""well they didn't really give a verbal affirmative yes but she wasn't saying no either, and they said they were crying but I never heard them cry because they were crying quietly"" et cetera et cetera), don't start fooling yourself into thinking you're not at fault here.  If you were accused of misconduct, there is ALWAYS something to regret.  Even if the experience was completely consensual and he/she/they still went home crying, you can't tell me with a straight face that there is nothing you would want to improve upon, that you would want to do better next time.  So if you're sitting across from an OIE investigator, my advice is this: figure out your regrets and pour them out.  Tell them what you should've done better.  Show that you're a better person.  Explain why you think you still deserve an education, and why you think you don't.  It's the right thing to do.

Second, don't expect forgiveness.  They don't have to give you any forgiveness.  What you need to focus on going forward is not that your victim thinks you're an okay human, but that you actually are an okay human.  In my personal opinion, what differentiates good and bad men is not that good men never make mistakes (or terrible ones, for that matter), but that good men devote the rest of their lives for making up their mistakes.  They learn, they grow, they regret, and they apologize a thousand times over.

Third, even if you believe you meant no harm, that doesn't mean what happened wasn't assault/harassment/rape.  Most assaults (\~90%) occur by friends and romantic partners, not by psychopathic strangers in scary white vans.  Just because your definition of rape is sensationalized doesn't mean that what your victim experienced wasn't rape.  All you need to make a sexual act misconduct (and necessarily, to make someone feel like shit) is a lack of affirmative consent.

# Conclusion

I hope this helps.  Please DM me if you have any questions.  For all others, please be nice in the comments.  I've posted on here before about sexual violence and found some exquisite trolls.  If you have a legitimate question or confusion, I will answer to the best of my knowledge.  While I am a survivor, I'm also doing academic research on campus sexual assault, and I'm part of several organizations on campus relating to sexual assault advocacy.  I'm no expert, but I'll do my best.  Thanks.
