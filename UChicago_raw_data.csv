1. Let’s say I’m sick. Where do I go? Do I need to go to a doctors office outside of campus? Is there somewhere within the campus I can go?

2. If I need general things from a store (socks, toothpaste, soap, drinks) is there a place within the campus to go to, or is something like this only obtainable from an outside location?

3. Is the public transportation really convenient and safe to get around Hyde Park and around the city? My mom is worried about this and wants me to take my car to make it easier on myself. 

4. Adding on to the last question, should I take my car? My mom is basically forcing me to take it, but I don’t know if that would be convenient and easy to do. Especially parking.... what’s parking like??

And I get it, as a first year, you are, to some extent, navigating uni/college blindly and can only learn through experience. But a recent voice message with them crying recently has pretty much spiked my concern. I’m a senior in a different university, so I constantly give them advice; I think it is very difficult for them to wrap their head around the tips I give them which may or may not make it easier to get through reading-heavy courses. And since I didn’t go through the Uchicago experience, this may also make it difficult to apply these tips.

If any sophomores - seniors have advice, tips, tricks, helpful experiences, know any resources etc for how to get through the reading-heavy required/core courses like Soc and Global Studies, I would really appreciate it.

As we all know crime has been on the rise in Hyde Park and particularly around Woodlawn with almost daily incidents of muggings, robberies, and assaults meaning that when we leave dorm to smoke at the end of a day of classes we are putting ourselves in a not insignificant bit of danger. 

 My reasoning is this: why not set up a chat group (Snapchat, Insta, Messenger, or whatever) to try and coordinate our exits so that we can go in SMALL groups rather than alone?  I am not suggesting we break social distancing guidelines but IMHO going in pairs or threes would feel significantly safer (not to mention possibly more enjoyable rather than going alone) and the risk is minimized by the fact that we all take COVID tests weekly anyways because we are all on university housing.

**\*Note:** The positive tests indicated in the **Total Cases** and the **University Testing program** sections may differ.

I joined clubs this quarter and occasionally grab lunch with a friend, but don't feel that I really have anyone that I can consistently rely on.

I’m currently in the process of self-studying the Spivak Calculus book, and have come to this wonderful sub for help. UChicago is one of the schools I’m aware of that has used Spivak regularly and historically for their honors calculus sequence, so it seemed natural to come here for guidance on how to structure my self study plan.
I’m currently on a leave of absence, with no teachers available to me, no constant internet access. All I have is Spivak and some scrap paper on which I can transfer notes from the internet by hand. Currently, I’m reading the chapter content and trying to go through every single problem in the book and it is incredibly time consuming. I understand this is a rigorous treatment of calculus, and “proper” maths takes time to learn, but surely you guys didn’t have time in your academic quarters to go through every problem in the book in addition to your other classes? For those of you who have gone through math 161,162,163 and I presume Spivak’s Calculus in its entirety, is trying to solve every problem necessary for someone with the goal of next learning Baby Rudin, Algebra, and higher level courses? Is it something students of the course naturally have to do through homework and lectures or do most students just select a handful from each chapter to go through?

I do wish to skip around some problems in order to get through the material quicker (at least quicker than I am right now), but the nature of Spivaks book seems to be of such that problems are interconnected, and at least within chapters, the key to solving one problem is in some problems prior, which I may have skipped. I guess I’m really looking for a good selection of problems that won’t sacrifice my understanding of the material, if that is advisable anyways. Any additional tips and know-how in getting through this book would also be greatly appreciated! 

Thank you for your time if you’ve actually made it this far.

1604978651.0,0.0,50.0,"Hello,

I am a 2014 college grad. During undergrad, I studied abroad with UChicago for a Chinese program and was at the receiving end of bullying comments and behavior by one of the instructors. I know this is nearly a decade later, but for a long time I never wanted to admit to myself that an instructor would behave this way toward students, that it had affected me so much, or that I was too timid to stand up for myself. This is a draft of an email I was going to send to the Dean of Students. Should I bother? I removed certain details to try to keep the instructor as anonymous as possible for the purposes of this post. Thank you!



EDIT: I submitted my grievance, and here is the final draft I sent, with identifying details removed.
""Dear Office of the Dean of Students:
I am a 2014 college graduate and studied abroad with the university in [quarter], [year], in [location] for the [program]. I understand that this is an extremely late grievance and I don't expect anything to come out of it, but this instructor's behavior was too outrageous and made for too hostile an environment and I wanted to leave a written record of my complaint. For the longest time, I didn't want to admit to myself that I was too timid to stand up for myself, or that this had affected me so deeply, or that an instructor - someone whom I'd trusted - would engage in such degrading behavior toward students.

The instructor whom I'm mentioning has made inappropriate remarks involving students' appearances, including repeatedly remarking that a male student was handsome, and on one occasion, explicitly stating that a female student was not good looking enough.

On one occasion, the instructor was handing out tickets for students to see a performance and did not hand one to me. When I inquired why, he explicitly stated that it's ""because I don't like you."" (因为我不喜欢你). 

He has made his disdain for me even more apparent on other occasions as well. Against my better judgment, I confided in him that my father used excessive corporal punishment against me when I was a child. For one of our assignments, we were to watch a movie in the Chinese language and write about it. I am a heritage speaker of Chinese, but do not have the language fully mastered. I asked the instructor whether it would be okay for us to watch ""you xi ji"" (游戏机） for the assignment. My intention was to ask whether it was okay to watch a classic Chinese series referred to as ""xi you ji."" （西游记）. However, I mistakenly switched ""xi"" and ""you."" When I mistakenly switched those two words, I mistakenly said ""video game"" instead of ""classic."" To my surprise, the instructor then responded by saying, ""No wonder your dad beat you."" (难怪你爸爸打你.) In my confusion, I asked why wanting to watch a classic instead of a regular movie would result in my dad beating me, and then he told me I switched the words around. In response, I told him I accidentally said it wrong, to which he instructed me, ""then don't say it wrong."" (那就不要说错). I was truly shocked and hurt by his words - first and foremost, I also work as a language instructor now, and the only way students learn is through making mistakes, and that secondly, he would take this innocent mistake and then imply that I deserved to be beat for it.

There are other examples in which his behavior made me truly uncomfortable and his palpable disdain for me, which he vocalized on numerous occasions, caused me great anxiety and stress, such as instances in which he criticized my lifestyle choices or told me that his impression of me was that I was a lazy student, but I will leave it at this. All quotations here are the English translations of the original Chinese, to the best of my memory. I have also included the Chinese quotations, in case anyone wishes to verify the accuracy of my translations. While the instructor certainly has the right to dislike me all he wants, he does not have the right to engage in discriminatory behavior, and I believe he has crossed the line of what is acceptable.

Again, I understand that this inquiry is coming in extremely late, and while I don't expect much to come out of it, I wish for an administrator to acknowledge my grievance and leave a written record of my grievance. I also understand that this also carries the risk of retaliation by that instructor, but I write this message in complete good faith and am willing to stake my personal and professional reputation on the veracity of my complaint. 

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Confirms a record 1,848 first-years. Admit rate went from initial 6.2% to 7.3%. They vastly over admitted to get a huge class. Yield dropped from 80% to 74%. No doubt this was all COVID related. What does this mean for next year? Dean Boyer claimed the target size of the College was 7,000 with a class of 1,700 to 1,725. You can't keep admitting 1,848 first years and stay at 7,000.

**\*Note:** The positive tests indicated in the **Total Cases** and the **University Testing program** sections may differ.

For example, I know how to do the delta epsilon proofs, but I don’t rly understand the concepts behind just going through the motions. I feel like 151 is a bit fast paced for me, and I typically spend like 6 hours a week at office hours/tutoring trying to figure out what was glossed over in class. The first few problem sets, to me, seemed like they were in some other language, although as time goes on they seem kind of easier and more computational.

Given that, does 131 sound right for me? I’ve heard conflicting accounts of whether or not it’s really “easier,” and some people warn of way more quizzes and p sets than are found in the 150s. 151 hasn’t been unbearable so far, but I’m definitely trying to maximize my GPA so maybe the extra tutorials and all that for 130s would be better?

This could be a fairly controversial post. I want to begin by saying that I completely empathise with all of you about having such a watered-down first year, both socially and academically. Your first year in college is supposed to be a time to reinvent yourself, find or advance your passions, meet lifelong friends, and grow to become more mature and independent. Many of these things will be hindered significantly by the challenges posed by COVID-19. I was lucky to have a normal first year, and I am incredibly grateful for it. It's a shame you all won't be able to experience the same right now.

That being said, the desire for a normal year should not blind us from the very real threat the coronavirus poses. Over the last few days, lots of people have seen tons of first-years (and some upperclassmen) congregating in big groups, in close quarters, when many of you all are supposed to be quarantining. As someone who is friends with RAs in on-campus housing, I have heard that there have been serious problems with first-years sneaking out of their 10-day quarantines (which are less strictly enforced than the 14-day ones) to gather socially. As you can imagine, management is far from happy with the current social climate, and there have been talks among RHs about the need to shut housing down this early.

Presumably, many of you came to campus for a reason: to get some semblance of a normal college year. But there are others of us who came to campus out of necessity. Some don't have stable internet connections at home. Others don't have a home environment that is conducive to work, or have unhealthy familial relationships. There are also people who can't go back to their families due to travel restrictions. By neglecting basic social distancing measures and touting necessary precautions, you are not just putting yourself and your college experience this year at risk; you are risking the academic potential and mental health of many of your peers and upperclassmen who are doing everything right because they HAVE to.

The fallout from campus closing down has far greater scope than on just the students. If an outbreak on campus does occur and students are sent home, we would be seeding every city in America and many across the world with new coronavirus cases that each have the potential to cause a local resurgence of the virus. Members of this community could be sent home the minute dorms are forced to close. Thus, we have not only a responsibility for the health of our peers and professors, but a responsibility to the world to be safe.

This post isn't calling for all of you to lock yourselves in your rooms and not talk to anyone for the rest of the quarter; that would defeat the purpose of many of you coming here in the first place. But I ask all of you, for the sake of our less privileged peers, to be more aware of the steps we can take to minimise the spread of the virus. Fulfil your quarantine instructions to the best of your ability. When meeting your peers, stay distanced from them and wear masks, even if you are outside. Don't stay in proximity of too many people for too long. Avoid large groups. These are all simple, fairly non-restrictive steps all of us can take.

I plead with you to read and think about this with an open mind. The impact of your actions could not only have an impact on you, but your peers, professors, families, and communities. Thank you.",uchicago,Dear First-Years...,149.0,0.94

3. we’ll play something along the lines of rock/alternative/indie music and probably start with covers of cool songs, so genre matching is quite essential (but most of the time we’re just gonna jam in our free time, so don’t feel like you need to skip out if you’re more into jazz or hardcore)

4. maybe kinda don’t come in with very high expectations??? we don’t really know what we’re doing yet (or ever) and whether Logan is even gonna open for rehearsals, so this is more for fucking around to get through the existential dread of the place where fun goes to die

I'm currently brainstorming some potential program offerings for 2nd years and would really like to hear some thoughts on the sort of topics, program structure, and any other general ideas that 2nd years would like to see more of!

Some ideas I currently have:

\- more volunteer opportunities that encompass different fields/industries with potential grants/stipends given out at the end/after a certain number of hours (because we all know that second year resumes might not be as built out as 3rd/4th years due to lack of experience,etc.)

\- potential collaborations with professors to source more research opportunities to second years (who again might have problems due to lack of experience)

\- more field/major explorations programs such as more shadowing opportunities, or more meetings with alumni or upperclassmen in the field/major

Some other ideas: 

 \- Maybe collaborations between different RSO’s on campus and non-profit organizations so that even ordinary club members can get some experience. I.e. such as the gardening club (UChicago horticulture club) with local parks to do a greenery initiative? This will really reward students who are active in an RSO and encourage students to participate in more extracurricular activities. 

\- More programs/initiatives that help students start their own startups and non-profits – whether by introducing them to alumni who have done this, providing funding for startups and starting a non-profit, or teaching students about how they can go about doing this.

—

The political culture here is toxic beyond what I could have possibly expected. It’s not just pro-Biden, it’s anti-Trump—to the point that all Trump supporters are despicable human beings who are undeserving of respect and who should promptly be cancelled.

Recently, this guy in the Class of 2024 group chat basically asked if there were any fellow Trump supporters in the group, or if he is alone.^[1]

Shortly after, several people acknowledged the guy’s perfectly legitimate question as ‘bait’ because... “no way someone can be so delusional as to support Trump, right?”^[2]

When it became apparent that it was not in fact ‘bait’, some of the group’s radical leftists rose to the occasion to make it clear that if you support Trump, you are unworthy of their respect and that because you support a “terrible person”, you too are a “terrible person”.^[3] ^[4] ^[5]

This university proudly portrays itself as an environment of free speech, where people are encouraged to share their ideas and discuss them, no matter how much their ideologies differ from one another. Clearly this isn’t the case when it comes to politics.

Are people no longer entitled to their own political views? Is the political culture so toxic here that one is automatically assumed to have bad character if they support Trump?

Yesterday afternoon, a friend of mine parked on 53rd St. near Greenwood Ave. and later found that someone had struck her car while she was away. A witness reported the license plate number of the driver who hit her to the police and they tracked down the driver, who admitted to causing the accident and leaving the scene.

While the investigation happened, I stopped into a nearby shop that had security cameras pointed at that intersection. The owner let me watch the footage, which definitely shows the accident, though it's small and hard to make out precise details. That said, the footage clearly shows a cyclist riding between the parked cars along the curb, and the van that struck my friend's car. It also appears to show the cyclist getting smashed by the van in the accident. It's unclear whether the cyclist was actually struck - or, if they were, whether they were injured. There was no blood near the scene of the accident, and it appears they took off immediately after the collision.

The shop owner told me that the security cameras tape over themselves every day, but he let me record the playback of the footage on my phone. I showed the footage to the officers who were conducting the investigation, but they seemed uninterested in it. My friend called the non-emergency line today and offered to share the video and they declined.

Anyway, I'm a rising second year this year and pretty undecided about my major. I'm finishing all my Core classes pretty soon and obviously have to think about majors and such. However, I feel like I'm a bit of a crossroads because I came in wanting to be an English/Creative Writing major and I took World Lit for my HUM, which while I enjoyed, I didn't love it as much as I thought/hoped I would. I mean, the texts were definitely fun to read, but I found that the type of analysis that I was asked to do in class didn't appeal to me as much. On the other hand, I took Classics as my SOSC and absolutely loved it. The texts and reading were definitely less ""fun"" and a bit more dry, but found that I got a lot more out of them and the type of analysis that I was asked to do was a lot more interesting. Plus, I got to have some really interesting conversations about politics and government with my profs in office hours which was really cool. This difference could have been due to my profs and their different styles of teaching (even though I was really lucky to have really good profs for both HUM and SOSC all three quarters), but it definitely has me thinking more in the way of Political Science/Philosophy. 

At the moment, I'm pre-registered for an intro Political Science class and an intro English class just because I don't want to rule it out completely, but due to the really positive experience I had with Classics, I'm wondering what majors I should look into and the benefits/drawbacks to both the Political Science and Philosophy majors.

1596753319.0,0.0,2.0,"Hi, I just saw a post about which math sequence to take as a physics major, and seeing as the astrophysics major has a slightly different set of math requirements, I was hoping to get some feedback. I was placed into math 153/161(+IBL)/183 with the option to take the higher-level exam. I am currently leaning more towards 183 because by taking 183 and the next class in the sequence, 184, I fulfill credit for both math requirements in the astrophysics major and fulfill credit for 151 and 152. If I take 153, then I still have to take 183 and 184, so there's no point to do that. Alternatively, instead of 183, I can take 163 and fulfill one of the math requirements for the astro major, but I would still have to take 184, 19620, 20250, or 23000 afterward (I can jump right into any of these, as I believe the 160s count as the prerequisites).  I've heard fantastic things about the 161-162-163 sequence (and it's IBL counterpart), and they sound like sequences I would be really really interested in taking. I've learned how to write some linear algebra proofs in HS, although I don't know how beneficial that would be. If I opt for the 160s sequence, I would have to take an additional 2 quarters worth of math classes, so I am unsure of which to do. A quick note: I do not plan on double majoring or minoring in math (I plan on doubling in PubPol actually, a weird combo I know). I was hoping to see what you all think.
