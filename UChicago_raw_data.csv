0.0,1613343712.0,37.0,uchicago," Questions like this have been asked before and I've read them all, but a recent poll on the class groupme got we thinking again. I'm a first year here on my second quarter on campus and, honestly, I'm feeling terribly conflicted about the entire experience.

I know this year deviates extraordinarily from the normal, and this quarter is going a lot better than the first, but I still feel so lonely. I have a couple people I text and a couple people I hang out with occasionally, but I don't feel like I really fit in with a group. The poll on the groupme suggested that a majority of people had a strong group of friends, and I'm so jealous of them.

I wasn't by any means a popular kid growing up, but I had a solid group of friends all through high school. Now, I'm listening to them tell stories of their new friends while I'm in my room, alone, doing some pset, terrified of losing them, which only exacerbates my anxiety that I'm just inherently unlikable and I'll spend all four years here more or less alone with temporary friendships that disappear out of college.

I'm aware that I'm being melodramatic and am maybe too caught up in the tv-sitcom-sold fantasy of making a found family with your college roommates a la friends and new girl. I know that real life doesn't work that way, and I'm extrapolating from the closeness I see between people on social media, but from right now, everything feels so lonely.

I've tried to put myself out there, reaching out through ig, pming people in my classes. I even tried rushing a sorority last quarter, but although I could see how beneficial it was for other people, greek life simply wasn't for me. I'm not really sure where to go from here.

I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on when they found the people they felt at home with, whether it happened later in your four years or right off the bat, and also how they went about it.

So, I'm using my AP Spanish test for the language requirement, and am thinking of taking AP Biology (4,5), AP Statistics (5), AP Calculus BC (4,5\*), and AP Physics C: Mechanics (5).                                                                 \* ^(I probably need a 5 for the 18000 math sequence)

My school does not offer AP Physics C: Mechanics, so I'm currently trying to self-study for it (in a semester), so I wanted to ask if any of you recommend I take it at UChicago instead (so that I can discard it totally from my list since self-studying leaves many gaps in understanding &amp; is just overwhelming to do it simultaneously with my Calc self-study.... while having a bunch of other things to do in school and at home....not me venting :-|).

The Bio, Stats, Calc, and Spanish credit look, overall, more helpful.

And I get it, as a first year, you are, to some extent, navigating uni/college blindly and can only learn through experience. But a recent voice message with them crying recently has pretty much spiked my concern. I’m a senior in a different university, so I constantly give them advice; I think it is very difficult for them to wrap their head around the tips I give them which may or may not make it easier to get through reading-heavy courses. And since I didn’t go through the Uchicago experience, this may also make it difficult to apply these tips.

If any sophomores - seniors have advice, tips, tricks, helpful experiences, know any resources etc for how to get through the reading-heavy required/core courses like Soc and Global Studies, I would really appreciate it. I really want to have a sit down with them to create a relevant if not workable study plan to make the experience less painful.

However, the second one (which I am hoping to take) says that the class will be ""surveying works of literature, theology, philosophy, sufism, politics, history, etc., written in Arabic, Persian and Turkish"".

As we all know crime has been on the rise in Hyde Park and particularly around Woodlawn with almost daily incidents of muggings, robberies, and assaults meaning that when we leave dorm to smoke at the end of a day of classes we are putting ourselves in a not insignificant bit of danger. 

 My reasoning is this: why not set up a chat group (Snapchat, Insta, Messenger, or whatever) to try and coordinate our exits so that we can go in SMALL groups rather than alone?  I am not suggesting we break social distancing guidelines but IMHO going in pairs or threes would feel significantly safer (not to mention possibly more enjoyable rather than going alone) and the risk is minimized by the fact that we all take COVID tests weekly anyways because we are all on university housing.

Would this be something any of y'all would be interested in? If so, reply below.

P.S.

1) We are aware smoking is unhealthy, however 2020 has been a shitty year and we all have different ways of coping.  Replying ""stop smoking"" is missing the point of this post

Some students have even chosen to major in math instead of physics because, ironically, that would allow them to skip the mundane 211 sequence and take more fruitful physics classes than if they actually majored in physics.

If this really is the case, that is if the sequence is so widely frowned upon by undergrad and grad students alike, why hasn’t the department done anything about it? They seemed to have no problem with ditching PHYS 154 (Modern Physics) last year after realizing its utter worthlessness. Any thoughts on the consensus surrounding the 211s? And what will it take for them to do away with the sequence?

5. Are the advisors helpful if I reach out and ask them this?
6. Any tips/advice?

1. Do you regret choosing UChicago instead of an easier school for pre med?
2. Are the classes well taught? 
3. Can you connect with professors?
4. Are there good shadowing opportunities and research? 
5. The stat on UChicagos website says 80 smthn % of pre meds get into med school.. is that stat true or is that stat because Chicago has weeder classes?

I'll admit that I'm kind of shy, but I've never really had any trouble making friends in the past. I had a strong, consistent group of friends in high school that I (optimistically maybe lol) feel will be my friends for life. I know friendships don't happen overnight, but I really want to make connections with people here.

I came without any real connections made prior. No one from my high school is here and I feel like maybe it's too late to randomly reach out on instagram etc. I didn't get super close to to the people in my hallway and sometimes I feel like I'm annoying the few people I do know, which just exacerbates my anxiety. I joined clubs this quarter and occasionally grab lunch with a friend, but don't feel that I really have anyone that I can consistently rely on. At this point it looks like people have made their friend groups, and I'm not sure with online classes/clubs how I can break into any of them or form my own. I definitely don't want to spend the rest of university sad and lonely, but I'm not sure where to go from here.

I’m currently in the process of self-studying the Spivak Calculus book, and have come to this wonderful sub for help. UChicago is one of the schools I’m aware of that has used Spivak regularly and historically for their honors calculus sequence, so it seemed natural to come here for guidance on how to structure my self study plan.
I’m currently on a leave of absence, with no teachers available to me, no constant internet access. All I have is Spivak and some scrap paper on which I can transfer notes from the internet by hand. Currently, I’m reading the chapter content and trying to go through every single problem in the book and it is incredibly time consuming. I understand this is a rigorous treatment of calculus, and “proper” maths takes time to learn, but surely you guys didn’t have time in your academic quarters to go through every problem in the book in addition to your other classes? For those of you who have gone through math 161,162,163 and I presume Spivak’s Calculus in its entirety, is trying to solve every problem necessary for someone with the goal of next learning Baby Rudin, Algebra, and higher level courses? Is it something students of the course naturally have to do through homework and lectures or do most students just select a handful from each chapter to go through?

I do wish to skip around some problems in order to get through the material quicker (at least quicker than I am right now), but the nature of Spivaks book seems to be of such that problems are interconnected, and at least within chapters, the key to solving one problem is in some problems prior, which I may have skipped. I guess I’m really looking for a good selection of problems that won’t sacrifice my understanding of the material, if that is advisable anyways. Any additional tips and know-how in getting through this book would also be greatly appreciated! 

Thank you for your time if you’ve actually made it this far.

0.0,1604978651.0,50.0,uchicago,"Hello,

I am a 2014 college grad. During undergrad, I studied abroad with UChicago for a Chinese program and was at the receiving end of bullying comments and behavior by one of the instructors. I know this is nearly a decade later, but for a long time I never wanted to admit to myself that an instructor would behave this way toward students, that it had affected me so much, or that I was too timid to stand up for myself. This is a draft of an email I was going to send to the Dean of Students. Should I bother? I removed certain details to try to keep the instructor as anonymous as possible for the purposes of this post. Thank you!



EDIT: I submitted my grievance, and here is the final draft I sent, with identifying details removed.
""Dear Office of the Dean of Students:
I am a 2014 college graduate and studied abroad with the university in [quarter], [year], in [location] for the [program]. I understand that this is an extremely late grievance and I don't expect anything to come out of it, but this instructor's behavior was too outrageous and made for too hostile an environment and I wanted to leave a written record of my complaint. For the longest time, I didn't want to admit to myself that I was too timid to stand up for myself, or that this had affected me so deeply, or that an instructor - someone whom I'd trusted - would engage in such degrading behavior toward students.

The instructor whom I'm mentioning has made inappropriate remarks involving students' appearances, including repeatedly remarking that a male student was handsome, and on one occasion, explicitly stating that a female student was not good looking enough.

On one occasion, the instructor was handing out tickets for students to see a performance and did not hand one to me. When I inquired why, he explicitly stated that it's ""because I don't like you."" (因为我不喜欢你). 

He has made his disdain for me even more apparent on other occasions as well. Against my better judgment, I confided in him that my father used excessive corporal punishment against me when I was a child. For one of our assignments, we were to watch a movie in the Chinese language and write about it. I am a heritage speaker of Chinese, but do not have the language fully mastered. I asked the instructor whether it would be okay for us to watch ""you xi ji"" (游戏机） for the assignment. My intention was to ask whether it was okay to watch a classic Chinese series referred to as ""xi you ji."" （西游记）. However, I mistakenly switched ""xi"" and ""you."" When I mistakenly switched those two words, I mistakenly said ""video game"" instead of ""classic."" To my surprise, the instructor then responded by saying, ""No wonder your dad beat you."" (难怪你爸爸打你.) In my confusion, I asked why wanting to watch a classic instead of a regular movie would result in my dad beating me, and then he told me I switched the words around. In response, I told him I accidentally said it wrong, to which he instructed me, ""then don't say it wrong."" (那就不要说错). I was truly shocked and hurt by his words - first and foremost, I also work as a language instructor now, and the only way students learn is through making mistakes, and that secondly, he would take this innocent mistake and then imply that I deserved to be beat for it.

There are other examples in which his behavior made me truly uncomfortable and his palpable disdain for me, which he vocalized on numerous occasions, caused me great anxiety and stress, such as instances in which he criticized my lifestyle choices or told me that his impression of me was that I was a lazy student, but I will leave it at this. All quotations here are the English translations of the original Chinese, to the best of my memory. I have also included the Chinese quotations, in case anyone wishes to verify the accuracy of my translations. While the instructor certainly has the right to dislike me all he wants, he does not have the right to engage in discriminatory behavior, and I believe he has crossed the line of what is acceptable.

Again, I understand that this inquiry is coming in extremely late, and while I don't expect much to come out of it, I wish for an administrator to acknowledge my grievance and leave a written record of my grievance. I also understand that this also carries the risk of retaliation by that instructor, but I write this message in complete good faith and am willing to stake my personal and professional reputation on the veracity of my complaint. 

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Given that, does 131 sound right for me? I’ve heard conflicting accounts of whether or not it’s really “easier,” and some people warn of way more quizzes and p sets than are found in the 150s. 151 hasn’t been unbearable so far, but I’m definitely trying to maximize my GPA so maybe the extra tutorials and all that for 130s would be better?

**\^Note:** The Total Cases &amp; Contact Tracing weekly data is actually tallied from in a time-window two days offset from the University Testing Program data (10/23-10/29).

**\*Note:** The positive tests indicated in the **Total Cases** and the **University Testing program** sections may differ. This is not only because of the reasoning in the previous note, but also because the **Total Cases** section counts both positive results from the University testing program as well as ""cases identified among members of the University community who sought testing"" per the UChicago go forward website.

**\*\*Note:** The % Change between weeks for positivity rate is calculated by subtracting the current week from the previous week, which is different from the calculation for total tests and positive tests.

1. Mindset of abundance. I took zero classes the last two quarters and I had way more time to do things that were important to me. You start to choose to do things instead of being forced to and you start to live more. You start to reflect more and pursue hobbies and develop interest

2. Free time is important and really underrated by the university. Hip Hop was invented because people were bored and wanted to build sound systems and play with records.  Einstein's first papers were written during free time, etc.

3. Why do you care about taking classes? It might feel like you're not spending your money right, but if you end up suffering more in each class when you take classes is it really worth it?? If it's b/c everyone else is doing it, just know that I am taking 0 classes til I graduate and ngl I am a very successful student and very happy with where I am academically

It will be social and will be focused on sharing the difficult things in life that can be so hard to share due to the social pressures of college.

I really hope to make a positive impact and help as many people as struggling silently and alone. I'm currently developing it and would love any and all feedback.

This could be a fairly controversial post. I want to begin by saying that I completely empathise with all of you about having such a watered-down first year, both socially and academically. Your first year in college is supposed to be a time to reinvent yourself, find or advance your passions, meet lifelong friends, and grow to become more mature and independent. Many of these things will be hindered significantly by the challenges posed by COVID-19. I was lucky to have a normal first year, and I am incredibly grateful for it. It's a shame you all won't be able to experience the same right now.

That being said, the desire for a normal year should not blind us from the very real threat the coronavirus poses. Over the last few days, lots of people have seen tons of first-years (and some upperclassmen) congregating in big groups, in close quarters, when many of you all are supposed to be quarantining. As someone who is friends with RAs in on-campus housing, I have heard that there have been serious problems with first-years sneaking out of their 10-day quarantines (which are less strictly enforced than the 14-day ones) to gather socially. As you can imagine, management is far from happy with the current social climate, and there have been talks among RHs about the need to shut housing down this early.

Presumably, many of you came to campus for a reason: to get some semblance of a normal college year. But there are others of us who came to campus out of necessity. Some don't have stable internet connections at home. Others don't have a home environment that is conducive to work, or have unhealthy familial relationships. There are also people who can't go back to their families due to travel restrictions. By neglecting basic social distancing measures and touting necessary precautions, you are not just putting yourself and your college experience this year at risk; you are risking the academic potential and mental health of many of your peers and upperclassmen who are doing everything right because they HAVE to.

The fallout from campus closing down has far greater scope than on just the students. If an outbreak on campus does occur and students are sent home, we would be seeding every city in America and many across the world with new coronavirus cases that each have the potential to cause a local resurgence of the virus. Members of this community could be sent home the minute dorms are forced to close. Thus, we have not only a responsibility for the health of our peers and professors, but a responsibility to the world to be safe.

This post isn't calling for all of you to lock yourselves in your rooms and not talk to anyone for the rest of the quarter; that would defeat the purpose of many of you coming here in the first place. But I ask all of you, for the sake of our less privileged peers, to be more aware of the steps we can take to minimise the spread of the virus. Fulfil your quarantine instructions to the best of your ability. When meeting your peers, stay distanced from them and wear masks, even if you are outside. Don't stay in proximity of too many people for too long. Avoid large groups. These are all simple, fairly non-restrictive steps all of us can take.

I plead with you to read and think about this with an open mind. The impact of your actions could not only have an impact on you, but your peers, professors, families, and communities. Thank you.",Dear First-Years...,t3_iz4o6p,148.0,0.94,kumar8551

unless there are a whole lot of people who wanna participate, which i doubt, there will be no auditions (duh) and you’ll become a part of the band where everyone *definitely* knows how to play music right away!

requirements:

1. you don’t have to have some pro skill in the instrument that you’re playing, but we appreciate enthusiasm and passion for playing music!

2. it’d be nice if you were from class of 2024 as it’ll be sad if you graduate earlier than everyone else and we become a sad band that is never gonna be the same without their other member :(

3. we’ll play something along the lines of rock/alternative/indie music and probably start with covers of cool songs, so genre matching is quite essential (but most of the time we’re just gonna jam in our free time, so don’t feel like you need to skip out if you’re more into jazz or hardcore)

4. maybe kinda don’t come in with very high expectations??? we don’t really know what we’re doing yet (or ever) and whether Logan is even gonna open for rehearsals, so this is more for fucking around to get through the existential dread of the place where fun goes to die

I'm currently brainstorming some potential program offerings for 2nd years and would really like to hear some thoughts on the sort of topics, program structure, and any other general ideas that 2nd years would like to see more of!

Some ideas I currently have:

\- more volunteer opportunities that encompass different fields/industries with potential grants/stipends given out at the end/after a certain number of hours (because we all know that second year resumes might not be as built out as 3rd/4th years due to lack of experience,etc.)

\- potential collaborations with professors to source more research opportunities to second years (who again might have problems due to lack of experience)

\- more field/major explorations programs such as more shadowing opportunities, or more meetings with alumni or upperclassmen in the field/major

Some other ideas: 

 \- Maybe collaborations between different RSO’s on campus and non-profit organizations so that even ordinary club members can get some experience. I.e. such as the gardening club (UChicago horticulture club) with local parks to do a greenery initiative? This will really reward students who are active in an RSO and encourage students to participate in more extracurricular activities. 

\- More programs/initiatives that help students start their own startups and non-profits – whether by introducing them to alumni who have done this, providing funding for startups and starting a non-profit, or teaching students about how they can go about doing this.

I am an incoming first year, and I have confirmed loads of times before that I will be off-campus, taking all of my classes remotely this fall. However, on my housing portal, I see that they have assigned a dorm for me. However, I am afraid to check it as there is a mandatory step for accepting legal terms and conditions first. So, at this point, Idk if I should accept the legal terms and conditions to view which dorm I will be in whenever I arrive at campus - maybe in the spring; I mean I am afraid these legal terms are only meant for the fall quarter and by accepting them I confirm that I will be on-campus in the fall, which is not the case.

—

The political culture here is toxic beyond what I could have possibly expected. It’s not just pro-Biden, it’s anti-Trump—to the point that all Trump supporters are despicable human beings who are undeserving of respect and who should promptly be cancelled.

Recently, this guy in the Class of 2024 group chat basically asked if there were any fellow Trump supporters in the group, or if he is alone.^[1]

Shortly after, several people acknowledged the guy’s perfectly legitimate question as ‘bait’ because... “no way someone can be so delusional as to support Trump, right?”^[2]

When it became apparent that it was not in fact ‘bait’, some of the group’s radical leftists rose to the occasion to make it clear that if you support Trump, you are unworthy of their respect and that because you support a “terrible person”, you too are a “terrible person”.^[3] ^[4] ^[5]

This university proudly portrays itself as an environment of free speech, where people are encouraged to share their ideas and discuss them, no matter how much their ideologies differ from one another. Clearly this isn’t the case when it comes to politics.

Are people no longer entitled to their own political views? Is the political culture so toxic here that one is automatically assumed to have bad character if they support Trump?

So, in short, I ranked in person classes as my top choices but now wish I did the opposite, as I would probably prefer to just do all of first quarter remote and avoid the shitshow-to-come.

I am interested in enrolling in UChicago's law school's 'Public Law and Legal Theory' workshop. I will begin my Master's this Fall and hope to use the Master's degree as a springboard to a doctoral program in Anthropology focused on socio-cultural theory and legal theory.

When I learned about the Public Law and Legal Theory Workshop, I was very excited because of the exposure and engagement it provides students to legal theory. I believe the workshop might help to strengthen my legal competency and investigation into legal regimes and help me become a more competitive applicant.

I wanted to learn about other people's experiences regarding the workshop.

2. Was it difficult to pass the workshop (it is pass/fail)? 
3. Did you enjoy the workshop? Why or why not? 
4. What were the discussions like between students and faculty?

Yesterday afternoon, a friend of mine parked on 53rd St. near Greenwood Ave. and later found that someone had struck her car while she was away. A witness reported the license plate number of the driver who hit her to the police and they tracked down the driver, who admitted to causing the accident and leaving the scene.

While the investigation happened, I stopped into a nearby shop that had security cameras pointed at that intersection. The owner let me watch the footage, which definitely shows the accident, though it's small and hard to make out precise details. That said, the footage clearly shows a cyclist riding between the parked cars along the curb, and the van that struck my friend's car. It also appears to show the cyclist getting smashed by the van in the accident. It's unclear whether the cyclist was actually struck - or, if they were, whether they were injured. There was no blood near the scene of the accident, and it appears they took off immediately after the collision.

The shop owner told me that the security cameras tape over themselves every day, but he let me record the playback of the footage on my phone. I showed the footage to the officers who were conducting the investigation, but they seemed uninterested in it. My friend called the non-emergency line today and offered to share the video and they declined.

I have no way of knowing who the cyclist is, whether they were hurt, or whether they want to pursue this.

In that role I will focus on the following issues: i) continuation and evolution of strategic initiatives of the University; ii) re-enforcing the enduring values of the University and our distinctive approach to research, education, and impact; iii) continuing key relationships of the University – with trustees, friends, donors, alumni, and parents; federal, state, county, and city officials; local community leaders and partners; global partners; and leaders and supporters of our key institutional partners – University of Chicago Medical Center, Argonne, Fermilab, and the Marine Biological Laboratory; iv) high level fundraising; and v) working with my successor as president to assist them to better contribute in these directions. As Chancellor, I will also serve as a Trustee of the University.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **MATH 16100 (Honors Calculus IBL)**
2. **PHYS 14100 (Honors Mechanics)**
3. **HUMA 11500 (Philosophical Perspectives)**
4. SOSC 11400 (Power, Identity, Resistance)

Since I have done well in AP Physics C and the proof-based mathematical courses I have taken, I think I am well-prepared to enter the math and physics class.   Additionally, I have a solid background in composing essays (and reading through dense texts), so I am somewhat familiar with the standards of HUMA and SOSC.  I am not concerned about the content difficulty of these courses *per se*, but the time commitments involved in these courses. Is it impossible for me to lead a relatively normal life while succeeding in these courses, or are reports of their ""notoriety"" exaggerated?   I am genuinely interested in all of the above courses, and I would relish the experience of taking them.  Nonetheless, I am as concerned about my grades as I am about the ""life of the mind,"" and I would not want my grades to suffer by overwhelming myself.

If this schedule is impossibly intense, I could substitute the SOSC class for an ""easier"" one, or scrap SOSC altogether and take a CORE BIO class or a CIV class.   Any thoughts are appreciated!

Anyway, I'm a rising second year this year and pretty undecided about my major. I'm finishing all my Core classes pretty soon and obviously have to think about majors and such. However, I feel like I'm a bit of a crossroads because I came in wanting to be an English/Creative Writing major and I took World Lit for my HUM, which while I enjoyed, I didn't love it as much as I thought/hoped I would. I mean, the texts were definitely fun to read, but I found that the type of analysis that I was asked to do in class didn't appeal to me as much. On the other hand, I took Classics as my SOSC and absolutely loved it. The texts and reading were definitely less ""fun"" and a bit more dry, but found that I got a lot more out of them and the type of analysis that I was asked to do was a lot more interesting. Plus, I got to have some really interesting conversations about politics and government with my profs in office hours which was really cool. This difference could have been due to my profs and their different styles of teaching (even though I was really lucky to have really good profs for both HUM and SOSC all three quarters), but it definitely has me thinking more in the way of Political Science/Philosophy. 

At the moment, I'm pre-registered for an intro Political Science class and an intro English class just because I don't want to rule it out completely, but due to the really positive experience I had with Classics, I'm wondering what majors I should look into and the benefits/drawbacks to both the Political Science and Philosophy majors.

My fall schedule goes like this:

HUM core: PATH

MUSI 15100 Harmony and Voice Leading I

CMSC 16100 Honor intro CS I

(HIST 13100 Western Civ or MATH 16110 Calc ibl)

I originally planned to take Western Civ because I kind of like the idea of cold calls and the topic itself, in addition to the course’s good reputation. However, IBL sounds so FUN and INTERESTING to me. I like the ideas that students prove things on their own and present their proofs in front of the class and interact with each other more often. But I also worried that two honors might be too much, especially the other being CS. If I choose not to do IBL, I will probably take MATH 15300 or 15910 in Spring, depending on my higher math placement.

If IBL is really that interesting as I imagine it would be, I won’t mind putting countless time in it. If it’s not IBL but the regular honor clac sequence would I rather take Western Civ.

In consideration of dropping off Western Civ, is IBL really worth it, and are honors CS+Calc IBL doable? I really appreciate if anyone in this sub could give me some advice on what I should do, thanks!

EDIT: THANK YOU ALL GUYS! I think I am going to challenge myself a little bit and take IBL with Honor CS together this year. Can’t resist the interestingness of IBL lol.

1. 131 seems to have significantly more class hours than 151, so is it also more comprehensive? Or is it very similar in difficulty to 151, just with more work?

2. If I want to major in Computer Science, will MATH 131 meet the prerequisite requirements I need for some classes?

I was placed into math 153/161(+IBL)/183 with the option to take the higher-level exam. I am currently leaning more towards 183 because by taking 183 and the next class in the sequence, 184, I fulfill credit for both math requirements in the astrophysics major and fulfill credit for 151 and 152. If I take 153, then I still have to take 183 and 184, so there's no point to do that. Alternatively, instead of 183, I can take 163 and fulfill one of the math requirements for the astro major, but I would still have to take 184, 19620, 20250, or 23000 afterward (I can jump right into any of these, as I believe the 160s count as the prerequisites).
