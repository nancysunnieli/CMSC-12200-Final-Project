I am very interested in reaching out to the Tories to establish a sister-chapter at Penn for the reasonable man or woman- one that is not affiliated with the College Republicans and allies itself more with history and science more than gossip and media driven politics. This would be the first such society here at Penn and I hope it acts as a non-exclusive, intellectual, social gathering more than anything else. Plus, heard the Roaring 20's are going to start next year so might as well plan ahead for that!

Now, for better or for worse, I am a STEM major and I have very few scholarly contacts in history, economics, political science, classics, area studies, bepp, etc. which I feel will be the departments worth reaching out to more than say sociology. I'm trying to gauge at interest here and trying to develop a leadership team.... so pls comment or PM me if you are interested. I plan to reach out to the Yale Tories in the next few days or so.

27M here. I currently hold a Bachelor degree of Science in Mechanical Engineering-CAD since 2018 and been working as a mechanical engineer at a shipyard in Newport News, VA for nearly two years. I was born and raised in New York City and moved to Newport News for the job.

In recent months, I became interested in computer programming, web design, and coding. I have no experience in coding though I have done some form a web design decades ago. So I am researching schools I would like to attend and the University of Pennsylvania is one of my choices.

I do have a couple of questions I would like to ask the people in this reddit community:

1. In a normal time, what is student life like at UPenn as a graduate? How are things there now in light of the pandemic?

2. Any affordable apartments near the area (30 mins at most)? I'm looking at a range from $700 to $1200.

3. Any good places on and off campus to make new friends? Probably school clubs?

4. For those, undergraduates and graduates, who moved to Philadelphia from another state, what has the moving experience been like?

5. Is still paying off undergraduate student loans an issue as a graduate? If so, what are some ways to help pay it off?

6. Any good medical, dental, and visual plans in Pennsylvania?

That's all I have for now.

Before I begin, I apologize for the delay. This week has been really busy. **I need help running this, so please reach out if you are interested.** Some of what you may do is spread awareness, gather students' concerns, lobby student government and Penn, and attend meetings with Penn officials like the one I had last week. Also, [sign the petition](https://www.change.org/PennCovidTransparency) if you have not already!

I met with two of Penn's COVID-19 communication officials: Emily Patterson, owner of [@COVIDPenn](https://twitter.com/COVIDPenn) on Twitter, and Mary Kate Coghlan, Director of Communications for Student Wellness. Both were receptive to many ideas and questions I offered. They also have direct lines of communication with decisionmakers and data teams to relay our questions, concerns, and recommendations. **This is the first of several meetings we plan on having. We are looking for students from across campus and the university to join in our discussions. Please reach out to me if you are interested.** These future meetings will provide updates on what we discussed previously will be detailed as well as a venue for students to have a seat at the table regarding Penn's COVID-19 policy.

A decent amount of progress was made, as detailed below. However, we must make sure that Penn follows through with this progress as well as advocate for more progress. The following is a condensed version of what was discussed. For more information, please go see [the full document of meeting outcomes and findings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yqJFbBVVTzne0LVQxH6fzUq6jktzy6ot/view?usp=sharing).

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID-19 Dashboard**

* Weekly updates may soon come with the data stratified by day instead of just by week.
* Distribution of on/off-campus cases and charts of the seven-day average may become available soon.
* We will continue pressing for daily updates of the dashboard.

**Communication**

* An FAQ section has been added in the comments and full document with answers to common questions by students including what happens at tier levels, how tier levels are activated, contact information, and more.

**Red Pass**

* UPenn follows the 14-day quarantine policy of Philadelphia.
* Red Pass will tell you when to get tested, usually in 7 days after being exposed to someone positive with COVID-19.

**Residential Advisors**

* Concerns were forwarded to the administration. I don't think those I met with were in the position to do much regarding RAs.
* Residential advisors may be heard most if they seek the help of student government.

**The Future**

* Regular meetings with Ms. Patterson and Ms. Coghlan will be scheduled to give students a seat at the table.
* If you would like to join in these meetings, please email Aden Yacobi at [ayacobi@sas.upenn.edu](mailto:ayacobi@sas.upenn.edu) or message [@TransparentPenn](https://twitter.com/TransparentPenn).
* Also reach out if you would like to join in spreading awareness, gathering concerns, and lobbying staff. We need help!

""Moving past QAnon, and on to some revelations that I have yet to see considered by the press (the increase in espionage, corporate cronyism, censorship, and cybercrime are the probable causes), is the likelihood that “Covid-19”, or the respiratory, and cognitive symptoms that people have been reporting, are caused by unwittingly ingested nano- and micro-chip technologies, with wifi capacities, that are inciting abnormal cell behavior throughout the body’s systems. ""

""For example, a recent QAnon rumor that “vaccines” cause gay sexual behavior, sounds absolutely ludicrous, but what these insiders know is that wi-fi enabled ingestible brain technologies can be used to send messages (“thoughts”, topics, sensations, and visuals) that can be used to inspire the receiver to begin to question their sexual preferences, orientation, gender orientation, or preferences. ""

""Instead of demanding that we gag ourselves and others, let’s free ourselves to think more broadly and deeply about this fascist, tech-supported, technocratic, quantum-age “plandemic”, do the requisite research, and demand that our Executive, Judicial, and Legislative branches save us from bio-technology cyber-attacks. ""

Yeah... it's a lot. I won't be including anything about the author, such as the name or the email included, but if you want to find it, it's in the essays that are pinned up. I seriously hope this is some kind of satire, because I certainly had a laugh while reading it.

Additionally, I've also written an email to her, just asking her where she got her information, with a fake name and email. The Google Doc is hosted on that email, so it's not my real name. I just don't feel safe having my name out there.

The class is a brutal piece of work, so I made my cheat sheet as comprehensive as possible. So as to make the class easier for anyone who'd benefit, I'm linking here the cheat sheet I put together. The cheatsheet includes every definition, theorem, and proof completed in last Fall's iteration of CIS160 with Rajiv that I deemed potentially relevant to the final (including everything proved from lectures and recitations and most things proved in the homework). This took MANY long hours of LaTex, which is to say I was half-dead type-setting it, so it is by no means error-free. Still, concepts and general proofs may prove useful to some. Final disclaimer, the collection of proofs prolly won't get you through any kind of assessment if you don't understand them, so it's better used as an inspiration for a proof method than an all-knowing answer sheet.

I was able to take classes under some of the most interesting people I have ever encountered. I co-published research. I interned abroad at a top notch lab under a Penn grant. I even took two completely unrelated classes in Nursing and Marketing! Above all, I became close with majors in my department and developed mentors and a mentee. Because of all these awesome experiences, I am confident I will be successful in my future grad school and research endeavors.

Now the shitty part- I came to Penn having worked my ass off much like 99% of the school. However, as an Asian-American man going into science, I had to sacrifice a lot during high school to get to Penn because I knew very well I would have to differentiate myself in more than one way. So, when I entered I was incredibly relieved and excited to be here but unexpectedly, I had a major culture shock.

The kind of values cultivated in Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, etc households were at clash with the social expectations of an American college boy. I really struggled reconciling the two and there was almost no emotional or social help for someone like me. I was facing burnout from high school and recovering from a bad sports injury as well. CAPS and the multicultural centers and Greek life all failed me. The therapist at CAPS simply couldn't understand my issue. The multicultural centers were almost entirely dominated by a politically correct orthodoxy which didn't reach out to men in the way they did for women. And the fraternity system at Penn greatly privileged White and wealthy International students over others and I did not find anyone inside Greek life minding that at all! So, I decided to go my own way socially and joined research groups and club sports. I had a decent time and it all worked out in the end. But I have a confession: for every day for the first 3 years of college, I thought about leaving- just disappearing- because I felt no one but my family seemed to even notice me. I still sorta feel this way and I wonder if there are other Asian-American men who feel this way as well at Penn or have had a negative social experience especially in the first 2 years ?",Asian-American Male Experience at Penn,t3_lhy1sx,179.0,0.96,[deleted]

Tomorrow, I will be talking with the manager of @COVIDPenn and the Director of Communications for Wellness to present our recommendations. To recap, these are:

1. Daily updates of the UPenn COVID-19 dashboard
2. More clear communication regarding policy and goals.

Further concerns have since been brought to my attention that I will attempt to address tomorrow. These include:

1. Better case breakdown (on campus vs off)
2. The red pass policy and the reasoning behind the long quarantine times and lack of testing for those exposed but not necessarily positive with the virus
3. RA concerns, specifically in the Quad

If you have any concerns with transparency, messaging, or just want to clarify something, please let me know in the comments below. I will bring them up and hopefully get you back an answer.

I don’t know what if this meeting will lead to any tangible outcomes or not. So please sign and more importantly [share the petition](https://www.change.org/PennCovidTransparency) if you haven’t to show a unified student response. We know this activism works because it’s already got us this far. I’m hopeful that further speaking up will compel Penn to treat us students as the stakeholders we are. I will update you all tomorrow after the meeting. Until then, stay safe out there.

TL;DR - Petition got noticed and I’m speaking to some administration officials tomorrow to bring up our concerns. If you have other concerns, questions or experiences that are worthwhile to share, please comment them below. Lastly, sign and share the

Since so many people are asking, I figured this is as good a place as any to report some of the figures from Penn's weekly COVID dashboard update ([https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/content/dashboard](https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/content/dashboard)).

How it's going: **not great, and getting worse**

* New positive tests: 261 (151 week prior)
* Overall positivity rate: 2.22% (1.09% week prior)
* Symptomatic/contact tracing positivity rate: 26.20% (11.92% week prior)
* Students in isolation: 388 (222 week prior)
* Students in quarantine: 654 (388 week prior)
* Isolation capacity available: 56.9% (83.4% week prior)

We're seeing sharp increases almost exclusively within the undergraduate population, which comprises **239 of the 261 new positive tests (that's 91.57%)**. By comparison, 5 are graduates and 17 are faculty/staff/postdoc/other. It's patently obvious that undergraduates are driving the surge in reported cases.

Last week, Penn sent a message to the community warning of increased Level 3 restrictions that could come as early as this week. The level of transmission on campus is evidently high. If you don't care about yourself, please consider all of the other faculty, staff, and staff-in-residence who depend on their health and jobs at Penn for their livelihoods, and other Penn students who would much prefer not to deal with the consequences of your selfish inaction. Do not be part of the reason why they're sick, out of a job, or otherwise indisposed.

Please stay up to date by visiting [https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/announcements](https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/announcements). Stay healthy, stay safe, and for f\*ck's sake, wear a mask, keep your distance, and stop going to parties, even with your bffs.

The other three bedrooms are each fully furnished with a desk and bed. The unit comes with its own laundry (washer and dryer) and a full A/C system. The house has been rented by students for the past 12 years and the landlord is really nice and the neighbors/community are great too! The house also has a full and newly renovated kitchen (fridge, freezer, microwave, stoves and countertop), dining table with chairs, and a 65’ TV. If you wish to not have the house furnished, that is also an option too! There is also a balcony with chairs and a table.

Someone in my dorm/bathroom pod (that I honestly have never seen before in my life) has tested positive for COVID and put the rest of the pod in a 15 day quarantine. The bathrooms are cleaned three times a day and pod members are required to wear a mask and wipe down our spaces - this has been the rule since the beginning of the semester. A few hours before I got my red pass, I had a spit test which ended up being negative a day later.

Someone in our pod told me that they had a friend who had a red pass due to their pod mate testing positive and then that friend was given a green pass three or four days later (instead of the usual 15). I am posting to ask everyone if you have ever heard of this happening before? Is the 15 days actually something that we will have to follow through until the end even after multiple negative tests during this time period?

I'm not asking this to be difficult or to try and find a way out or anything, I just heard this from someone and was curious on what warrants it?

While Penn’s reporting system quickly provides an individual their risk of having COVID-19, it does not provide an individual their risk of catching COVID-19 from others.
Two common-sense solutions can help UPenn and the students prevent a campus outbreak: (1) daily updates of testing statistics and (2) more clear communication of policy.

I am an independent student who is currently highly aided. In 2020 I received some money from inheritance (it’s not a lot at all) and I have to report it on my taxes this year as income. 

The money is not currently in my possession and I used some of it to buy a used car, the rest is in an account under my sister’s name so I can save it for my graduate degree. 

I don’t know what to do about my financial aid next year? My income will look very high, when in reality I do not even have most of the money left anymore. Because of this, I put the numbers into the EFC calculator and the price is more than I can afford, it is half of my total income for the year. 

I just don’t understand how they expect me to pay so much when the income I got is 
1. Not even a livable wage for a year and 
2. I am an independent student who supports myself, therefore I have spent a lot of the money already

""A MESSAGE TO THE PENN COMMUNITY ABOUT COVID POSITIVITY RATES FROM: 
Wendell Pritchett, Provost
Craig Carnaroli, Executive Vice President
Benoit Dubé, Associate Provost and Chief Wellness Officer

The University is seeing worrisome trends in the positivity rate of COVID-19 in our undergraduate student population this week. This situation is concerning amidst the emergence of highly transmissible variants in nearby communities.

It is critical that students only gather with their pod while watching the Super Bowl or when doing any other activities. Do not gather with people outside of your pod. 

We have been sending students home for conduct not in line with the Student Campus Compact, and will continue to do so throughout the semester.

Remain vigilant—mask up, maintain a safe distance, wash your hands. Don’t be the weakest link; if trends don’t reverse, we will move into Campus Alert Level 3–a campus-wide Safer at Home order—imposing new restrictions as early as next week.

It just seems ironic, considering that no small portion of the people now silent were the ones most aggressively pestering kids in our class when the celebration screenshots came out. It seems that personal opinions are coloring the social/political positions being held, which, I guess when you think about it, isn't actually that surprising. Of course, for the people who are staying consistent to ""holding people accountable,"" good on you.

Now, I don't think there's any point in dragging this whole affair with the slideshow out longer. Was the powerpoint mean? Of course it was, and I hope those in it (who aren't taking it lightly, because, fair enough, even if personally I find the situation pretty humorous, I can see how it would be significantly less humorous if I was in it) realize the irrelevancy of the opinions of the idiot kids who made it and aren't hit too hard by it.

Still, I don't think there's any benefit to hounding the makers of the powerpoint. Won't achieve much, most likely. Plus, forgive and forget and all that stuff. Not just here, but in general. (But stop blaming /r/UPenn for making shit that was obviously not created here. I mean, seriously, that's a four year old's excuse. If you're not going to own up to it like an adult, at least put a better effort into pretending you didn't make it.)

But I find the occasional claims in defense of the slideshow-makers that there should be restraint *out of concern* for those responsible somewhat ironic (even if I think there's no point in retaliating or pursuing the case further), considering how little concern there was for the mental state of certain individuals in our class before.

I misinterpreted this as permission to use a calculator on the last step of the integral instead of just plugging in the bounds and simplifying.

You may have seen our [post last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/kqlft6/looking_for_a_summer_internship/) for our first round of summer applications - we're hoping to bring even more opportunities this month with our second round of the year! If you’ve already submitted, just sign in on the evening of Feb 5 for the opt in form. Otherwise, submit your details and resumes here before Thursday night: https://www.techintern.io/signup/student

This time around, we have some awesome AI (Cohere), blockchain (Tezos), data (Piinpoint) and also general tech companies (Zumper)! We also have several VC firms that are looking for their portfolio companies generally, so let me know what you think!

Feel free to dm me or email qile@techintern.io if you have any questions. I'm also happy to help with resume critiques, or chat about general thoughts on tech careers if you'd like :)",Looking for a summer internship?,t3_laiz3p,2.0,0.6,Eviticous

I am part of the University of Pennsylvania Occupational Medicine Residency program and we are conducting an online study trying to learn more about COVID-19 PPE availability and perceptions and burnout. We are an IRB approved study and are not collecting any personally identifying information. We are trying to include feedback from many different groups within the medical community so we can better understand PPE availability nationwide as well as how this is impacting healthcare professionals and things like burnout.

If you work in healthcare and have a few minutes to help, please take our survey. If you don’t work in healthcare but know somebody who does, please feel free to share this study with them. We are hoping the results from this study can lead to improvements in future policies.

0.0,1611465470.0,33.0,upenn,"Here is an overly complicated tutorial on how to set up you android home screen to automatically display your most recent PennOpenPass pass:

1. Make sure that the phone which you're using is receiving text messages whenever you get a new pass. You need to add your phone number on PennOpenPass, and maybe sign up for text reminders.
2. Go to the Play Store and download SMS Forwarder (see link in comments). Set up a filter in it as follows (leave all other settings in their default state):
   1. `Email or phone number`: Set this to any **gmail** address you have access to. We're going to be sending messages to it every time you get a new PennOpenPass pass, so choose an address where that won't bother you. Feel free to make a new email just for this, it takes like 2 minutes. For the sake of this tutorial, let's say you choose the email `name@example.com`
   2. `From who`: Set this to `+12672230163`. This is the number PennOpenPass uses to send notifications.
   3. `Rule for text`: Set this to `You have a`
   4. `Email subject`: Set this to `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass`
3. Fill out a PennOpenPass symptom check. You can do this even if you already completed one today. If we've set up everything correctly, you should receive an email with the subject `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass` which contains a link to your new pass.
4. Create a Rebrandly account (see link in comments) and create a link. We're going to set this link up to always forward to the link of your most recent pass. It doesn't matter what you set the destination to for now, just put google.com or something. You can set the link address to whatever you want, for the sake of this tutorial let's say you call the link `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`
5. Create a Zapier account (see link in comments) and create a new Zap, which should be set up as follows:
   1. In the `Gmail` option: `Trigger: New Email Matching Search in Gmail`, with the search set to `subject:([SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass)`. Make sure the email account you're using is the same one you're using with SMS Forwarder.
   2. In the `Formatter by Zapier` option: `Action: Text`, set to `Extract URL` from `Body Plain` (the body of the email)
   3. In the `Rebrandly` option: `Action: Update Branded Link in Rebrandly`, with the `Destination URL` set to the URL extracted in the previous step, and the `Link` set to the custom link you made earlier, in this case `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`.
6. Download Widgery (see link in comments) and create a new widget, whose `Web Address` is the custom link you made, `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`. You may also want to change some other settings, like turning on `When clicking on widget this will refresh the image` and `Image the same size as the widget` under `Advanced Settings`. Add the widget to your home screen (how you do this varies by device).

And we're done. If everything is working properly, every time you fill out a symptom check and get a new PennOpenPass pass, it will automatically be displayed inside the widget on your home screen (you will need to tap on the widget once to refresh it). I've only just set this up myself, so there may be some bugs to resolve, but it seems to be working pretty well.

If PennOpennPass just supported sending email alerts instead of text, or sending text alerts to VOIP numbers like Google Voice, then all of the SMS forwarding nonsense could have been avoided.",Automatically display PennOpennPass on Android home screen,t3_l3t6l9,33.0,0.94,lord_ne

0.0,1611358870.0,39.0,upenn,"Hi everyone. So, with people coming back on campus and Penn’s policies around quiet periods etc, the subreddit has been the place for a lot of discussion around COVID-related topics. Unfortunately, comment sections and posts are becoming more and more heated. In fact, we’ve had to ban more users in the past two weeks than we have in the entire prior year. 

  
Going forward, we want to remind members of our general stance towards comments and posts and outline our general process around deciding what content is appropriate vs. not appropriate for the subreddit.  


1. **Please remember to be respectful.** Calling people “lame”, “losers”, “narcs” etc or wishing ill will upon them is not the way to engage in respectful discussion with others. Those comments will be hit with a removal. Repeated comments of that nature will be hit with a ban. \[This falls directly under rule #1 of the subreddit. Unfortunately, this has also been the rule that has been violated the most as of late.\]
2. **Don’t engage with the troll.** For users that have a repeated history of engaging in spreading misinformation (e.g. “covid isn’t a big deal” “students won’t get complications” “it’s just a party bro”, etc), don’t engage with them. Just point it out to the mods and we’ll see if a ban is warranted. Ways to spot a troll: usually the #1 indicator is that they have no real history of going here. Other ways = them continuing to spout misinformation despite individuals attempting to convince them otherwise. Please use the report button if you suspect someone is a troll. \[This more or less falls under rules #1 and #5\].
3. **Don’t post identifying information.** In line with reddit policy around doxxing, please refrain from posting information about addresses, locations, etc. For the individuals who are posting about parties happening, **PLEASE** approach penn about it first ([https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl](https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl) or talk to your RA). If you do feel a burning desire to post, think about redacting specific identifying information. If someone could figure it out with a couple of google searches and having a few mutual friends with the people of interest, that information should probably be shared with penn instead of the internet.
4. **Do engage in discussion with those who have genuine questions about covid.** The #1 thing I’ve seen in my MPH program is that change in people's attitudes really does happen at the individual level. If you see someone asking whether something is true or not related to covid, engage respectfully with them in the comments if you believe they’re asking in good faith. Remember, all of you are a part of a community of thousands of individuals working at Penn.

We just did icebreakers which is pretty much what all my classes do. Afterwards they asked if any of us listen to any music. I though it was pretty weird as I never got a question like this from a professor before but I didn’t pay much attention too it. But right after their question, they mentioned how they just finished listening to whole lotta red by playboi carti and how it was a classic. At first, I thought it was a joke and chuckled.

I'm posting this again as I'd love to speak to more students.

My name is Nour Azhari and I'm a Clinical Psychology graduate from Columbia University. I am working on a research initiative to better understand **mental health on college campuses in the US**in order to develop new services that would meet those needs.

We are currently speaking to college students/recent grads who have either:

* Been referred out of their school counseling center
* Put on their center's waitlist (had to wait before your first session)

If you are one of those students, would you be open to speaking to us briefly for about 20 mins in the next few weeks? I would so appreciate your perspective, wisdom, and experience to help guide our efforts.

If you are willing to help us, please let me know what times work with you by directly scheduling a call with us: [https://calendly.com/greblernoam/mental-health-in-college-campuses](https://calendly.com/greblernoam/mental-health-in-college-campuses)

If you have any questions before, feel free to email me directly at: [nsa2124@tc.columbia.edu](mailto:nsa2124@tc.columbia.edu)

One of my top reasons for that is because I want to jump right into PA school from undergrad, but that is very rare. Another reason, is that I would have to be working a substantial amount of hours to get healthcare experience during undergrad. Thus, I believe that transferring internally to the School of Nursing would be a feasible option. If I were to become a PA, chances are I would be taking 1-2 gap years, and that is something I don't want to do. 

1. NP and PA are very similar professions (PAs have lateral mobility, but I am looking to work in general pediatrics/urgent cares/emergency medicine). A family nurse practitioner can do all of that.

Just because the vaccine rollout has started does not mean that ICUs are not still filling up and that healthcare workers and other essential workers are not still putting their lives at risk. It does not mean that people have stopped dying in recordbreaking numbers. If sitting on your ass and being bored for a year was the biggest hardship you've ever faced, you live a privileged life, and if you can't muster the self-control to do it, you don't deserve any respect and should really re-examine how your actions negatively impact the lives of others.

(Inspired by a couple of idiots I know who are facing a COVID scare of their own creation)

EDIT: to those wondering what's wrong with travelling if people follow the correct protocol, the problem is that, especially for people going on multiple short vacations, they're not doing any of that. nobody's quarantining for 10 days if they're only at an exotic locale for a week.",To all the students who are still traveling everywhere...

Would anyone who has been through this process before help me to write a strong request? i just want to make sure I’m doing things right :) I’ll list some of my reasons below: 

- I need to focus on my mental health recovery and I’m due to start CBD in the next few months (cognitive behaviour therapy NOT cock and ball torture) so I don’t want that being interrupted as last time it took me a solid year. 

- My dog is very old and has cancer and epilepsy. She doesn’t have long left and I want to be here for her when she passes. She was my main support when dealing with the death of my dad and it’s a lot to take in. I don’t want to spiral at college if she passes whilst I’m over in the US.  (Im worried they won’t realise how much this means to me and they’ll think I’m stretching just to make a stronger case? so I’m not sure if I should include this or not, even though it’s true)

- I’d really like to take part in a volunteering programme before I start college (how specific would I need to be about this?)

- Covid 19 is a huge issue as an international student from the UK. But I don’t think I’ll include it because of how many people will be requesting a gap year for this reason alone. What do you think?",Help/advice for applying for a gap year?,t3_ky5338,2.0,1.0,spindlehindle

0.0,1610257911.0,15.0,upenn,"Hello hello! Off-campus housing planning for the 2021-2022 academic year is somewhat beginning to get underway. For personal use of myself and some friends planning to go off campus, I found a spreadsheet template first developed by [u/Pianoplunkster](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pianoplunkster/) at UC Davis ([original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/3wpbgy/i_made_a_spreadsheet_template_to_help_you/)) from a while back and got to work. I've included all of the original user's tips available on the second tab, as well as made some of my own immediately relevant to Penn FinAid recipients. 

I've made some minor edits to the spreadsheet itself as well as formatted it as a table to allow for easier sorting. Perhaps the most significant edit is a cost-calculator (affectionately named ""Matthew's \~ Off-Campus, Cost-Cutting Calculator Extravaganza© \~""). It provides a month-by-month assessment of the total costs of living off-campus according to the assumptions laid out to the right and is affected by changing the values of marked cells to fit your housing estimates and predictions. Some notes are added to explain some of the formulas; the only thing I would add beyond what the spreadsheet already says is that ""realization of financial aid"" can come in the form of a bigger refund (for highly aided students) or just less money paid to the University (for moderately aided students). Either way, the effect is realized when Penn handles billing in September and January.

Important disclaimers: I am a current Sophomore and thus experienced with financial aid, but in NO WAY a hardened veteran of the system. I am personally confident enough in my formulas and estimates that they are useful to me, but I am still a mere mortal and cannot guarantee the calculator will be an effective forecast, particularly if Covid remains a force in the way Penn handles FinAid when September rolls around. I recommend you personally verify any estimates yielded with your financial aid counselor. All of that said, if you find any inaccuracies or problems with the template please feel more than free to comment below and I'll try to make edits to the sheet ASAP for my benefit and to avoid misinformation.

You can find a viewable version of the spreadsheet template [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQdNyUjSPZ9QQrUP8cS6GDCAAJX7hW6n/view?usp=sharing).

All but one of my profs were extremely helpful and helped work out alternate timelines which resulted in very good results in their classes. However, this one  prof was really inflexible and would not accommodate me during that time period so I ended up with a C in his class for being unable to catch up during that time period. I was unable to change the class to pass/fail in time because at the time of the deadline, my professor had said that as I was doing well then I did not need to.

I hope to apply for consulting internships in the next few years and really hope I can get much better grades in the upcoming semesters, do you think that those recruiting for internships would be considerate of these pandemic-era circumstances that played a role in this grade or would they look at it extremely negatively regardless?

For example, the Penn website says you get credit for AP Comp Sci A; but Wharton doesn't mention it as a course you get credit for. Is this because AP Comp Sci is not a required course at Wharton?

However, reading all these posts about certain professors being awful, mental health being awful, the President ( Amy? ) being...questionable, it’s making me a bit worried I won’t lie. Also, my interviewer seemed to low-key not like UPenn? They attended grad school but went to Cambridge for undergrad. I asked him what something he wished he could change was and he said how many student commit su*cide which definitely dampened the mood lol. He might be reading this actually: hi thank you so much for recommending me to admin!!

The new app is intended to be a helpful mental health resource. In the future it will be used for patients in therapy, but right now we are opening it up to college undergrads for research purposes. 

**The study is 1 month long and involves a total compensation of $50. This is broken down into $15 after week 1, $15 after week 3, and $20 at the end of the study.**

The basic layout of the study is as follows:

\- you would complete the informed consent and enrollment process on the secure RedCap platform

\- you would attend a short (&lt; 30min) webinar where a researcher would explain how the app works

\- for 28 days you would complete a 11 question daily survey (should take less than 5 min each day)

\- every other week you would complete a longer bi-weekly survey (and get paid after these)

\- at the end of the study you would receive a final payment. 

**If you are interested, please follow the RedCap link below to enroll. This will lead you to the informed consent where you can find out more information about the study.**

I spent my first two years at Penn struggling with depression and a serious eating disorder so I was never able to apply myself enough to join clubs or have a real social life. I spent junior year in therapy and by Spring 2020 I finally felt like myself again. I joined some clubs and felt like things were going to be okay. Then covid happened. I still felt hopeful because I thought senior year would be the year where I came into myself and would be able to apply everything I had learned to have a great year and graduate feeling proud of my college experience. I truly believe my senior year would have been amazing and made up for the disappointing college years that came before.

Instead I've been stuck in an abusive home environment for a year and will be graduating with very little to show for my college experience. I am so sad that my year will be the only Penn class to have never gotten hey day, feb club, and we possibly won't get graduation either. I had saved so many interesting classes to take my senior year and now I'm having to take them online, which I have a really hard time staying engaged with. I learned almost nothing this past semester online even though I'm taking the most important classes of my major. It makes me incredibly sad that I will never again experience an in person lecture or study in our libraries again. I'll never be able to go to Smokes. All the things that make college worth it, completely stripped. My personal, social, and academic life have all taken serious hits and I don't have another year of college to make up for it.

I guess this is just a post venting about covid and senior year but also I wanted to know if other seniors are experiencing this? No one is talking about it.

(disclaimer that I know this is nothing compared to the actual losses people have experienced this year) I wish the Class of 2021 Board would have some kind of event where we could all reflect and have collective grieving over what we have lost. Because right now I just feel totally isolated and like I'm the only one having such a hard time and missing what could have been of our senior year.

I am currently an undergraduate freshman and I honestly found CIS110 to be one of the least enjoyable classes I have ever taken in my life. I did some coding with Python in HS and thought the transition to Java wouldn't be so bad, especially since this course is branded as an introductory course.

The first few weeks weren't too bad and I felt like I was enjoying using Java. However, then came objects and it was right around the pass/fail deadline. I was hesitant about changing to pass/fail because I thought it was just the objects week that was going to be hard for me and because I plan to major in math where computer science can often times be important. However, that turned out to be a huge mistake. Ever since objects, my performance in the course plummeted. Trying to understand stuff from office hours and Piazza just took too much time and kept falling behind.

What absolutely sucks about this course is that they don't let you use any outside help. Whenever I couldn't understand stuff for a course in high school, I would just get a tutor, but they don't permit that here. Therefore, if you don't like the teaching style, you are screwed. It also just means your questions will take longer to be answered, which is incredibly inefficient. I talked to some older students from other universities who have taken computer science and they said their courses allow searching stuff up as long as you don't plagiarize stuff. I get that CIS110 is the university's course and not another university's, but the justification feel disingenuous to me. Them saying that StackExchange/Yahoo answers ""will likely be snarky, irrelevant to the assignment, or detrimental to the learning goals of the assignment,"" in my view, is an utterly contrived and dishonest reason.

I ended up with a D in this course. I am so upset at myself. I wasn't able to complete any of homework after the objects week because it got way too hard. I couldn't make any non-trivial progress on the final project. It didn't help that the homework was so project-based about material you just learned. I get that real life computer science is about projects but that's the phase where you are applying and should be more experience. At the learning phase, going to the deep end so suddenly throws me off.

I hate this. I hate how the stars all misaligned against me to screw me over. I hate how this course is so one-dimensional. I hate how this D is stuck on my transcript. I feel undergraduate career is ruined. If the class average for this course was a B+, I honestly don't belong in this university.

The professor decided to bell curve the final grade in the class, but not each individual assignment,  which also seems off to me. This grading method was never discussed in the syllabus either and there was no rubric for the assignments (which were all writing assignments), so we had no way of knowing what exactly was expected, which goes back to my point of the grading being arbitrary. I was wondering if this is normal at Penn? Shady grading policies unknown to the students and grading of assignments that seems rushed. Also the final grade distribution is not going to be published, which also seems sketchy to me.

In particular when people get the same weird (and wrong) answer, have gibberish and then the correct answer, or just do the problem in a style that is a bit off.

Well - it turns out that most of the exam is up on Chegg. It might not surprise you that two of the solutions are wrong (!) (you get what you pay for). Needless to say, it is pretty straightforward for me to identify patterns whether they came from Chegg or your friend.

Once I bump this up to the University, it is out of my hands. If do bump it up to the University, I will follow through on my promise about your future. I have seen the future, and it is not good.

On the other hand, you can come clean *right now*. Not tomorrow, not after I send you a personal email - now. In other words I have already identified a few exams. So, you should consider yourself already caught. Do yourself a favor and minimize the damage by contacting me. This goes for anyone who *knows* anyone who cheated. You can contact me and I will make sure it remains anonymous. If you are in that grey area where you gave your answer to, or helped someone - If I find out, you both go down. If you let me know and make your case, it will be easier for you.

You have until Noon ET December 27th.

Assuming, rent and average utilities is 1000, I'd pay ~5000 upfront.

 Given that I'm highly aided and would expect to receive a refund for housing and dining of around 14k in September, that would mean I'd have around 9000 left over (if I were to deduct the costs I paid using my own money) for rent from September to around April (given that my last months rent is covered and the security deposit covers another month), I would have around 2000 left. 

I haven't even included the cost of food yet or unexpectedly high utilities, so in reality, I don't see how I'd be saving money or getting pocket money with refunds. 

I'd love to have more freedom, especially going into next fall but at this point the cost of living seems concerning. If I were to stay on campus I'd basically get a 4000~5000 refund for meals, which is more than anyone really needs so financially, I'd be saving more actually staying on campus. 

However, it would be annoying given that I'd most likely be stuck around a bunch of sophomores in the highrises as an upperclassmen, but since I do have a little seniority in the housing process, I could possibly get a single apartment. In the end, I'd most likely have to move out every year, which is one of the benefits I see from off-campus housing, but I'm still unsure.

A Q&amp;A thread for admitted students will be posted in the sub after results have come out.

Good luck to all those waiting for their decisions!

# RESULTS ARE OUT!

**To those that were accepted:** Congratulations! Welcome to the Penn community! Penn was an instrumental part of my life and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Feel free to ask any and all questions in the Q&amp;A thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/kelgg4/official\_class\_of\_2025\_ed\_qa\_thread\_current/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/kelgg4/official_class_of_2025_ed_qa_thread_current/)

**To those that were rejected:** So sorry. College admissions is a crapshoot, and you should not determine your worth by this decision. I know that's easier said than done. I was in your shoes over a decade ago when I got rejected from my dream school. The tears and anger will subside, and as long as you don't let the rejection linger over you...you can make the best out of where you will end up and have a wonderful life. 11 years later, I'm thrilled I didn't get into my first choice.

Went to get tested for the first time today since they switched, and I guess I thought it was gonna be a cheek swab or something? Instead you have to stand there and spit into this little bottle until it fills halfway, which felt very messy and unsanitary and requires you to keep your mask off while standing there spitting. 

Also you can’t eat or drink anything for 30 minutes before the test, otherwise they said it would come out inconclusive. I just feel like that’s gonna be really hard for undergrads to follow, especially because I’ve seen how hard it’s been to get anyone to follow any basic health instructions/inconveniences this semester (speaking as an undergrad myself). I’m worried that people are gonna show up to the test just after breakfast or lunch or snacking and not care if they get an inconclusive. (Which maybe gives penn plausible deniability?)

It also was fine today since it was mostly empty, but they did have these dots spread 6ft apart I’m assuming for people to stand on when the campus returns. I feel like that’s not enough distance for college students to stand there and spit?? I really don’t want to go in for a saliva test and just having someone standing so close behind me with their masks off and actively spitting.

I scored below the 25 percentile on the midterm and that is the only thing keeping me up. I feel like I have a chance to fail the class (mainly because I feel intimidated by the material on the practice final and concepts, not where I am standing currently ofc), but would Tony Cai actually fail me? I'm trying but the average is so fricken high and I didn't even think I did that bad on the midterm looking at it alone, but the distributions say otherwise.

Generally, I hear that professors fail rarely and that is for people who don't turn in anything. If I bomb the final, could I still pass if I try?

I wrote this story about webcam requirements on my campus and decided I wanted to figure out what other college students around the country have been dealing with in regards to webcam use. How are most of your classes structured? Do they have Zoom lectures that are mandatory and, if so, do professors expect you have your cameras on at all times? I've learned a lot from other students at UC's and CSU's in California, but I want to get a better idea of how this issue is being tackled at a prestigious University such as yours.

I'm worried because PiT is giving me this message:

""You must request ALL parts of multiple activity courses, such as lecture/lab or lecture/recitation. Requests that do not meet this requirement will be automatically dropped daily during the Course Selection (Drop/Add) period. ""

And the professor of the course hasn't responded to my email so I'm scared that I will lose the recitation before the professor can possibly give me a permit for the lecture and cement my spot in the class.

My question is: what does ""dropped daily"" mean? Is it at midnight? 7am like the start of add/drop? or is it 24 hours from when I picked up the recitation?
