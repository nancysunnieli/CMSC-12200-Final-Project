0.0,1612486893.0,22.0,UPenn,"I think it's hilarious how the same people who would've been frothing at the mouths about boys rating girls with ""shots"" (even just for over the sexualization part, not to mention the equating of getting drunk and consenting to sex) either are ignoring the OAX incident or gave just a few tight-lipped comments because their friends were involved. It just seems ironic, considering that no small portion of the people now silent were the ones most aggressively pestering kids in our class when the celebration screenshots came out. It seems that personal opinions are coloring the social/political positions being held, which, I guess when you think about it, isn't actually that surprising. Of course, for the people who are staying consistent to ""holding people accountable,"" good on you.

Now, I don't think there's any point in dragging this whole affair with the slideshow out longer. Was the powerpoint mean? Of course it was, and I hope those in it (who aren't taking it lightly, because, fair enough, even if personally I find the situation pretty humorous, I can see how it would be significantly less humorous if I was in it) realize the irrelevancy of the opinions of the idiot kids who made it and aren't hit too hard by it.

Still, I don't think there's any benefit to hounding the makers of the powerpoint. Won't achieve much, most likely. Plus, forgive and forget and all that stuff. Not just here, but in general. (But stop blaming /r/UPenn for making shit that was obviously not created here. I mean, seriously, that's a four year old's excuse. If you're not going to own up to it like an adult, at least put a better effort into pretending you didn't make it.)

But I find the occasional claims in defense of the slideshow-makers that there should be restraint *out of concern* for those responsible somewhat ironic (even if I think there's no point in retaliating or pursuing the case further), considering how little concern there was for the mental state of certain individuals in our class before. Then, it was ""he doesn't get to claim mental health as an excuse for his problematic behavior;"" now, it's too often ""let's not be too hasty in casting judgment,"" or simply radio silence.",Some thoughts on the OAX situation,t3_lcvdvb,22.0,0.7

Although it was clearly stated in the syllabus and at the top of the quiz that calculators were not allowed, I did this because the question asked for a numerical answer and that you might not be able to give a decimal answer without a calculator. I misinterpreted this as permission to use a calculator on the last step of the integral instead of just plugging in the bounds and simplifying.

I am part of the University of Pennsylvania Occupational Medicine Residency program and we are conducting an online study trying to learn more about COVID-19 PPE availability and perceptions and burnout. We are an IRB approved study and are not collecting any personally identifying information. We are trying to include feedback from many different groups within the medical community so we can better understand PPE availability nationwide as well as how this is impacting healthcare professionals and things like burnout.

If you work in healthcare and have a few minutes to help, please take our survey. If you don’t work in healthcare but know somebody who does, please feel free to share this study with them. We are hoping the results from this study can lead to improvements in future policies.

0.0,1611465470.0,33.0,UPenn,"Here is an overly complicated tutorial on how to set up you android home screen to automatically display your most recent PennOpenPass pass:

1. Make sure that the phone which you're using is receiving text messages whenever you get a new pass. You need to add your phone number on PennOpenPass, and maybe sign up for text reminders.
2. Go to the Play Store and download SMS Forwarder (see link in comments). Set up a filter in it as follows (leave all other settings in their default state):
   1. `Email or phone number`: Set this to any **gmail** address you have access to. We're going to be sending messages to it every time you get a new PennOpenPass pass, so choose an address where that won't bother you. Feel free to make a new email just for this, it takes like 2 minutes. For the sake of this tutorial, let's say you choose the email `name@example.com`
   2. `From who`: Set this to `+12672230163`. This is the number PennOpenPass uses to send notifications.
   3. `Rule for text`: Set this to `You have a`
   4. `Email subject`: Set this to `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass`
3. Fill out a PennOpenPass symptom check. You can do this even if you already completed one today. If we've set up everything correctly, you should receive an email with the subject `[SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass` which contains a link to your new pass.
4. Create a Rebrandly account (see link in comments) and create a link. We're going to set this link up to always forward to the link of your most recent pass. It doesn't matter what you set the destination to for now, just put google.com or something. You can set the link address to whatever you want, for the sake of this tutorial let's say you call the link `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`
5. Create a Zapier account (see link in comments) and create a new Zap, which should be set up as follows:
   1. In the `Gmail` option: `Trigger: New Email Matching Search in Gmail`, with the search set to `subject:([SMSForwarder] New SMS from PennOpenPass)`. Make sure the email account you're using is the same one you're using with SMS Forwarder.
   2. In the `Formatter by Zapier` option: `Action: Text`, set to `Extract URL` from `Body Plain` (the body of the email)
   3. In the `Rebrandly` option: `Action: Update Branded Link in Rebrandly`, with the `Destination URL` set to the URL extracted in the previous step, and the `Link` set to the custom link you made earlier, in this case `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`.
6. Download Widgery (see link in comments) and create a new widget, whose `Web Address` is the custom link you made, `rebrand.ly/myCustomLink`. You may also want to change some other settings, like turning on `When clicking on widget this will refresh the image` and `Image the same size as the widget` under `Advanced Settings`. Add the widget to your home screen (how you do this varies by device).

And we're done. If everything is working properly, every time you fill out a symptom check and get a new PennOpenPass pass, it will automatically be displayed inside the widget on your home screen (you will need to tap on the widget once to refresh it). I've only just set this up myself, so there may be some bugs to resolve, but it seems to be working pretty well.

If PennOpennPass just supported sending email alerts instead of text, or sending text alerts to VOIP numbers like Google Voice, then all of the SMS forwarding nonsense could have been avoided.",Automatically display PennOpennPass on Android home screen,t3_l3t6l9,33.0,0.97

0.0,1611358870.0,34.0,UPenn,"Hi everyone. So, with people coming back on campus and Penn’s policies around quiet periods etc, the subreddit has been the place for a lot of discussion around COVID-related topics. Unfortunately, comment sections and posts are becoming more and more heated. In fact, we’ve had to ban more users in the past two weeks than we have in the entire prior year. 

  
Going forward, we want to remind members of our general stance towards comments and posts and outline our general process around deciding what content is appropriate vs. not appropriate for the subreddit.  


1. **Please remember to be respectful.** Calling people “lame”, “losers”, “narcs” etc or wishing ill will upon them is not the way to engage in respectful discussion with others. Those comments will be hit with a removal. Repeated comments of that nature will be hit with a ban. \[This falls directly under rule #1 of the subreddit. Unfortunately, this has also been the rule that has been violated the most as of late.\]
2. **Don’t engage with the troll.** For users that have a repeated history of engaging in spreading misinformation (e.g. “covid isn’t a big deal” “students won’t get complications” “it’s just a party bro”, etc), don’t engage with them. Just point it out to the mods and we’ll see if a ban is warranted. Ways to spot a troll: usually the #1 indicator is that they have no real history of going here. Other ways = them continuing to spout misinformation despite individuals attempting to convince them otherwise. Please use the report button if you suspect someone is a troll. \[This more or less falls under rules #1 and #5\].
3. **Don’t post identifying information.** In line with reddit policy around doxxing, please refrain from posting information about addresses, locations, etc. For the individuals who are posting about parties happening, **PLEASE** approach penn about it first ([https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl](https://upenn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6R4DIR9Pm2ziKsl) or talk to your RA). If you do feel a burning desire to post, think about redacting specific identifying information. If someone could figure it out with a couple of google searches and having a few mutual friends with the people of interest, that information should probably be shared with penn instead of the internet.
4. **Do engage in discussion with those who have genuine questions about covid.** The #1 thing I’ve seen in my MPH program is that change in people's attitudes really does happen at the individual level. If you see someone asking whether something is true or not related to covid, engage respectfully with them in the comments if you believe they’re asking in good faith. Remember, all of you are a part of a community of thousands of individuals working at Penn. It is **everyone’s** responsibility to be on board with covid guidelines so we can protect those who are most vulnerable.

I though it was pretty weird as I never got a question like this from a professor before but I didn’t pay much attention too it. But right after their question, they mentioned how they just finished listening to whole lotta red by playboi carti and how it was a classic. At first, I thought it was a joke and chuckled.

I'm posting this again as I'd love to speak to more students.

My name is Nour Azhari and I'm a Clinical Psychology graduate from Columbia University. I am working on a research initiative to better understand **mental health on college campuses in the US**in order to develop new services that would meet those needs.

We are currently speaking to college students/recent grads who have either:

* Been referred out of their school counseling center
* Put on their center's waitlist (had to wait before your first session)

If you are one of those students, would you be open to speaking to us briefly for about 20 mins in the next few weeks? I would so appreciate your perspective, wisdom, and experience to help guide our efforts.

If you are willing to help us, please let me know what times work with you by directly scheduling a call with us: [https://calendly.com/greblernoam/mental-health-in-college-campuses](https://calendly.com/greblernoam/mental-health-in-college-campuses)

If you have any questions before, feel free to email me directly at: [nsa2124@tc.columbia.edu](mailto:nsa2124@tc.columbia.edu)

One of my top reasons for that is because I want to jump right into PA school from undergrad, but that is very rare. Another reason, is that I would have to be working a substantial amount of hours to get healthcare experience during undergrad. Thus, I believe that transferring internally to the School of Nursing would be a feasible option. If I were to become a PA, chances are I would be taking 1-2 gap years, and that is something I don't want to do. 

1. NP and PA are very similar professions (PAs have lateral mobility, but I am looking to work in general pediatrics/urgent cares/emergency medicine). A family nurse practitioner can do all of that. 
2. If I get a BSN, RN, I would have job security after undergrad (work for 1 year and gain experience and apply to NP school, or I can apply straight out of undergrad).

Just because the vaccine rollout has started does not mean that ICUs are not still filling up and that healthcare workers and other essential workers are not still putting their lives at risk. It does not mean that people have stopped dying in recordbreaking numbers. If sitting on your ass and being bored for a year was the biggest hardship you've ever faced, you live a privileged life, and if you can't muster the self-control to do it, you don't deserve any respect and should really re-examine how your actions negatively impact the lives of others.

Would anyone who has been through this process before help me to write a strong request? i just want to make sure I’m doing things right :) I’ll list some of my reasons below: 

- I need to focus on my mental health recovery and I’m due to start CBD in the next few months (cognitive behaviour therapy NOT cock and ball torture) so I don’t want that being interrupted as last time it took me a solid year. 

- My dog is very old and has cancer and epilepsy. She doesn’t have long left and I want to be here for her when she passes. She was my main support when dealing with the death of my dad and it’s a lot to take in. I don’t want to spiral at college if she passes whilst I’m over in the US.  (Im worried they won’t realise how much this means to me and they’ll think I’m stretching just to make a stronger case? so I’m not sure if I should include this or not, even though it’s true)

- I’d really like to take part in a volunteering programme before I start college (how specific would I need to be about this?)

- Covid 19 is a huge issue as an international student from the UK. But I don’t think I’ll include it because of how many people will be requesting a gap year for this reason alone. What do you think?",Help/advice for applying for a gap year?,t3_ky5338,2.0,1.0

For personal use of myself and some friends planning to go off campus, I found a spreadsheet template first developed by [u/Pianoplunkster](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pianoplunkster/) at UC Davis ([original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/3wpbgy/i_made_a_spreadsheet_template_to_help_you/)) from a while back and got to work. I've included all of the original user's tips available on the second tab, as well as made some of my own immediately relevant to Penn FinAid recipients. 

I've made some minor edits to the spreadsheet itself as well as formatted it as a table to allow for easier sorting. Perhaps the most significant edit is a cost-calculator (affectionately named ""Matthew's \~ Off-Campus, Cost-Cutting Calculator Extravaganza© \~""). It provides a month-by-month assessment of the total costs of living off-campus according to the assumptions laid out to the right and is affected by changing the values of marked cells to fit your housing estimates and predictions. Some notes are added to explain some of the formulas; the only thing I would add beyond what the spreadsheet already says is that ""realization of financial aid"" can come in the form of a bigger refund (for highly aided students) or just less money paid to the University (for moderately aided students). Either way, the effect is realized when Penn handles billing in September and January.

Important disclaimers: I am a current Sophomore and thus experienced with financial aid, but in NO WAY a hardened veteran of the system. I am personally confident enough in my formulas and estimates that they are useful to me, but I am still a mere mortal and cannot guarantee the calculator will be an effective forecast, particularly if Covid remains a force in the way Penn handles FinAid when September rolls around. I recommend you personally verify any estimates yielded with your financial aid counselor. All of that said, if you find any inaccuracies or problems with the template please feel more than free to comment below and I'll try to make edits to the sheet ASAP for my benefit and to avoid misinformation.

You can find a viewable version of the spreadsheet template [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQdNyUjSPZ9QQrUP8cS6GDCAAJX7hW6n/view?usp=sharing).

All but one of my profs were extremely helpful and helped work out alternate timelines which resulted in very good results in their classes. However, this one  prof was really inflexible and would not accommodate me during that time period so I ended up with a C in his class for being unable to catch up during that time period. I was unable to change the class to pass/fail in time because at the time of the deadline, my professor had said that as I was doing well then I did not need to.

I hope to apply for consulting internships in the next few years and really hope I can get much better grades in the upcoming semesters, do you think that those recruiting for internships would be considerate of these pandemic-era circumstances that played a role in this grade or would they look at it extremely negatively regardless?

The new app is intended to be a helpful mental health resource. In the future it will be used for patients in therapy, but right now we are opening it up to college undergrads for research purposes. 

**The study is 1 month long and involves a total compensation of $50. This is broken down into $15 after week 1, $15 after week 3, and $20 at the end of the study.**

The basic layout of the study is as follows:

\- you would complete the informed consent and enrollment process on the secure RedCap platform

\- you would attend a short (&lt; 30min) webinar where a researcher would explain how the app works

\- for 28 days you would complete a 11 question daily survey (should take less than 5 min each day)

\- every other week you would complete a longer bi-weekly survey (and get paid after these)

\- at the end of the study you would receive a final payment. 

**If you are interested, please follow the RedCap link below to enroll. This will lead you to the informed consent where you can find out more information about the study.**

Since I’m in Wharton, I feel like taking OIDD477 might be the better option since I could count it towards the business breadth requirement, but it is only a half-semester/half-credit class so I’m worried that I might be missing out on learning a lot of crucial concepts.

I spent my first two years at Penn struggling with depression and a serious eating disorder so I was never able to apply myself enough to join clubs or have a real social life. I spent junior year in therapy and by Spring 2020 I finally felt like myself again. I joined some clubs and felt like things were going to be okay. Then covid happened. I still felt hopeful because I thought senior year would be the year where I came into myself and would be able to apply everything I had learned to have a great year and graduate feeling proud of my college experience. I truly believe my senior year would have been amazing and made up for the disappointing college years that came before.

Instead I've been stuck in an abusive home environment for a year and will be graduating with very little to show for my college experience. I am so sad that my year will be the only Penn class to have never gotten hey day, feb club, and we possibly won't get graduation either. I had saved so many interesting classes to take my senior year and now I'm having to take them online, which I have a really hard time staying engaged with. I learned almost nothing this past semester online even though I'm taking the most important classes of my major. It makes me incredibly sad that I will never again experience an in person lecture or study in our libraries again. I'll never be able to go to Smokes. All the things that make college worth it, completely stripped. My personal, social, and academic life have all taken serious hits and I don't have another year of college to make up for it.

I am currently an undergraduate freshman and I honestly found CIS110 to be one of the least enjoyable classes I have ever taken in my life. I did some coding with Python in HS and thought the transition to Java wouldn't be so bad, especially since this course is branded as an introductory course.

The first few weeks weren't too bad and I felt like I was enjoying using Java. However, then came objects and it was right around the pass/fail deadline. I was hesitant about changing to pass/fail because I thought it was just the objects week that was going to be hard for me and because I plan to major in math where computer science can often times be important. However, that turned out to be a huge mistake. Ever since objects, my performance in the course plummeted. Trying to understand stuff from office hours and Piazza just took too much time and kept falling behind.

What absolutely sucks about this course is that they don't let you use any outside help. Whenever I couldn't understand stuff for a course in high school, I would just get a tutor, but they don't permit that here. Therefore, if you don't like the teaching style, you are screwed. It also just means your questions will take longer to be answered, which is incredibly inefficient. I talked to some older students from other universities who have taken computer science and they said their courses allow searching stuff up as long as you don't plagiarize stuff. I get that CIS110 is the university's course and not another university's, but the justification feel disingenuous to me. Them saying that StackExchange/Yahoo answers ""will likely be snarky, irrelevant to the assignment, or detrimental to the learning goals of the assignment,"" in my view, is an utterly contrived and dishonest reason.

I ended up with a D in this course. I am so upset at myself. I wasn't able to complete any of homework after the objects week because it got way too hard. I couldn't make any non-trivial progress on the final project. It didn't help that the homework was so project-based about material you just learned. I get that real life computer science is about projects but that's the phase where you are applying and should be more experience. At the learning phase, going to the deep end so suddenly throws me off.

I hate this. I hate how the stars all misaligned against me to screw me over. I hate how this course is so one-dimensional. I hate how this D is stuck on my transcript. I feel undergraduate career is ruined. If the class average for this course was a B+, I honestly don't belong in this university. I'm not smart enough.",Rant About CIS110,t3_knjxzj,45.0,0.83

Grades were never made public on canvas, and there was no feedback on any assignments to even know what we did right or wrong, so the grading already seems arbitrary. The professor decided to bell curve the final grade in the class, but not each individual assignment,  which also seems off to me. This grading method was never discussed in the syllabus either and there was no rubric for the assignments (which were all writing assignments), so we had no way of knowing what exactly was expected, which goes back to my point of the grading being arbitrary. I was wondering if this is normal at Penn? Shady grading policies unknown to the students and grading of assignments that seems rushed. Also the final grade distribution is not going to be published, which also seems sketchy to me.

In particular when people get the same weird (and wrong) answer, have gibberish and then the correct answer, or just do the problem in a style that is a bit off.

Well - it turns out that most of the exam is up on Chegg. It might not surprise you that two of the solutions are wrong (!) (you get what you pay for). Needless to say, it is pretty straightforward for me to identify patterns whether they came from Chegg or your friend.

Once I bump this up to the University, it is out of my hands. If do bump it up to the University, I will follow through on my promise about your future. I have seen the future, and it is not good.

On the other hand, you can come clean *right now*. Not tomorrow, not after I send you a personal email - now. In other words I have already identified a few exams. So, you should consider yourself already caught. Do yourself a favor and minimize the damage by contacting me. This goes for anyone who *knows* anyone who cheated. You can contact me and I will make sure it remains anonymous. If you are in that grey area where you gave your answer to, or helped someone - If I find out, you both go down. If you let me know and make your case, it will be easier for you.

You have until Noon ET December 27th.

Assuming, rent and average utilities is 1000, I'd pay ~5000 upfront.

 Given that I'm highly aided and would expect to receive a refund for housing and dining of around 14k in September, that would mean I'd have around 9000 left over (if I were to deduct the costs I paid using my own money) for rent from September to around April (given that my last months rent is covered and the security deposit covers another month), I would have around 2000 left. 

I haven't even included the cost of food yet or unexpectedly high utilities, so in reality, I don't see how I'd be saving money or getting pocket money with refunds. 

I'd love to have more freedom, especially going into next fall but at this point the cost of living seems concerning. If I were to stay on campus I'd basically get a 4000~5000 refund for meals, which is more than anyone really needs so financially, I'd be saving more actually staying on campus. 

However, it would be annoying given that I'd most likely be stuck around a bunch of sophomores in the highrises as an upperclassmen, but since I do have a little seniority in the housing process, I could possibly get a single apartment. In the end, I'd most likely have to move out every year, which is one of the benefits I see from off-campus housing, but I'm still unsure.

Instead you have to stand there and spit into this little bottle until it fills halfway, which felt very messy and unsanitary and requires you to keep your mask off while standing there spitting. 

Also you can’t eat or drink anything for 30 minutes before the test, otherwise they said it would come out inconclusive. I just feel like that’s gonna be really hard for undergrads to follow, especially because I’ve seen how hard it’s been to get anyone to follow any basic health instructions/inconveniences this semester (speaking as an undergrad myself). I’m worried that people are gonna show up to the test just after breakfast or lunch or snacking and not care if they get an inconclusive. (Which maybe gives penn plausible deniability?)

It also was fine today since it was mostly empty, but they did have these dots spread 6ft apart I’m assuming for people to stand on when the campus returns.

I wrote this story about webcam requirements on my campus and decided I wanted to figure out what other college students around the country have been dealing with in regards to webcam use. How are most of your classes structured? Do they have Zoom lectures that are mandatory and, if so, do professors expect you have your cameras on at all times? I've learned a lot from other students at UC's and CSU's in California, but I want to get a better idea of how this issue is being tackled at a prestigious University such as yours. Please read and let me know what you think, I'm always looking for feedback.

I'm worried because PiT is giving me this message:

""You must request ALL parts of multiple activity courses, such as lecture/lab or lecture/recitation. Requests that do not meet this requirement will be automatically dropped daily during the Course Selection (Drop/Add) period. ""

And the professor of the course hasn't responded to my email so I'm scared that I will lose the recitation before the professor can possibly give me a permit for the lecture and cement my spot in the class.

I got a job in Manhattan after I graduate this spring and I’d like to live in Manhattan to avoid this same feeling of FOMO, despite the fact that some have advised me to live in Queens or Brooklyn and commute to work in order to save on rent. 

So my question to those who live in NYC is: would I be making a reckless financial decision by living in Manhattan w/ no roommates? Is living in Queens/Brooklyn analogous to living in West Philly, or are these boroughs exciting enough to not experience FOMO?

Because it’s relevant:
-I want to live in a studio/1BR. This will run me 2-3K/mo in Manhattan.
-I will be making 165K/year. (This will be liquid/not stock.)
-I will be paying off 70K in student debt over the next ~5 years.
-I’m single, so having fun places to meet single people + go on dates is a priority, and I’m under the impression Manhattan is the best borough for this.

But one of my TAs for a class suggested that I should just take MATH 313 instead of MATH 240. I see that MATH 313 has 240 as a prereq, but how difficult would it be to go directly from 114 to 313? Is there any big reason to take 313 over 240 (my TA and other upperclassmen told me 313 is much more interesting)? Also how does the work compare between the two classes??
