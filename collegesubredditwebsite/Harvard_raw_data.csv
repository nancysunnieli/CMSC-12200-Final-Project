I’m a recently admitted PhD student trying to make a decision on where to go. 

I’m curious about how the student insurance is. I read that the Harvard insurance is Blue Cross Blue shield , but I wanted to hear student experiences with it. In specific:

how is coverage and where do you go if you need treatment? 

For more serious stuff, which hospitals would you go to?

Is physical therapy covered and where is that provided?

What is the coverage outside of Boston / MA (say in NYC or CA), as well as internationally?

I'm a current freshman, and some of my friends went to OCS advising sessions and got extremely specific and helpful advice about getting internships. After I heard that I made appointment too, but I was really put off by mine. I asked for advice getting an internship in the field I'm interested in (industrial chemistry r&amp;d), but the advisor just said he really didn't know anything about it, that it was hard to get an internship in, and that he recommended I consider applying to consulting internships.

I was pretty disappointed that he had a lot more to say about consulting (which I'm not interested in) than what I am. He also said that I should get advice about this from the chemistry department, but my advisor in the chemistry department told me that I should talk to OCS because they're focused on academic chemistry!

I'm an incoming law student this fall and wanted to get a sanity check from all of u Cambridge veterans. I'm sorry for the vague and nooby nature of these questions, but I've never actually hunted for apartments or even dorms.

Seeing the rent rates in Cambridge coming from a mid-size Midwestern city is quite jarring; is $2000+ really a fair rate throughout Cambridge for a studio apartment? Is Harvard University Housing (HUH) a good route to go, or would I be better off looking at other private landlords? Or, even further, is my best bet just getting on-campus housing? Are there any Harvard-specific peculiarities in the housing process I should be aware of? If any of you are from the Midwest, what would you recommend for me to look out for in terms of particularly drastic changes in lifestyle/climate?

Also, while I'm here I figure I'll ask, even though no one possibly has an answer: what's you guys' ascertainment of the administration's attitude towards potentially returning to campus this fall? I go to a large state school that never really vacated campus except for the tail-end of spring 2020 (i.e. students are still living on campus and going to physical, albeit altered/hybrid classes), but I understand that Harvard's approach has been more cautious.

0.0,1612149139.0,17.0,harvard,"Hello all,

We would like to open up a discussion about Rule 2 of the sub. This is a checkup to make sure it reflects the needs and desires of this subreddit. This isn't in response to a particular event; this is just something we have come across several times and I figure it would be best to just let everyone discuss it and come to a consensus (if that's not too optimistic). 

As of this post, rule 2 is:

&gt; 2) No advertising or soliciting non-Harvard sponsored products, apps, surveys, or other materials.*
&gt; 
&gt; *: Special arrangements can be made to advertise officially recognized events and organizations directly related to Harvard subject to moderator approval. Contact the moderators directly to inquire.
&gt; 

This rule is meant to filter posts that advertise things.

The wording and conditions of Rule 2 have changed slightly over the years; for a while it was just ""No advertising or soliciting""; then we added ""of non-Harvard sponsored ...""; then we added the asterisk. The original intent of the rule was to filter out spammy posts advertising because of the subreddit's name and reputation. However, there are of course legitimate things to advertise so we had to figure out how to best draw the line, hence all the changes. 

---

As it stands, the current rule requires that any person or organization not officially recognized by the University seek moderator approval before advertising an event, service, opportunity, etc. There have been plenty of queries that we've denied, but there have been some that we have approved. The MO for our decision-making is: ""is this advertisement useful, relevant, and legitimate?"" For example, the [Jeopardy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/jo2g8j/the_jeopardy_national_college_championship/) post was useful, relevant, and legitimate. However, there are some advertisements that we don't think meet those criteria (e.g. a high school tutoring company seeking to hire Harvard student tutors). We believe something like that crosses the line into spam and/or reputation-seeking. 

Please chime in below with your thoughts on the current rule, and if there are any changes or tweaks you would like to see. For example, do you agree with the two instances I gave above?

---

*Keep in mind that the primary purpose of this subreddit is to serve current Harvard students and alumni (though we do welcome people from other colleges, prospectives, etc to interact).

I'm a freshman that just finished up Math 25a, CS 61, Stat 110 and Ec10a, and am taking Math 25b, CS 124, CS 181 and Expos this spring. I'd love to hear about meaty STEM courses that are under-rated and worth taking, even if they aren't in math/CS (but especially welcome if they are). For example, I think AM 226 (Neural Computation) sounds like a hidden gem, and Physics 210 (GR) looks fascinating. I'd love to take both next year or as a junior. 

I'm planning on taking Math 118r (Dynamical Systems), Stat 210 (Graduate Probability) and MIT's 6.837 (Computer Graphics) next fall as a sophomore and doing economics research this summer, and would love to discover courses that people have enjoyed in the past, but that aren't ""common/standard"" STEM courses (I think Math 118r is another example of such a ""hidden gem"" of a topic).

I've noticed that club sports at some schools seem to be around the same level as high school varsity sports, with many even having their own coaching staff.  Is this what it's like for club sports at Harvard?

Also, I'm really interested in joining a club that will give the chance to travel around.  Do club sports travel to compete at other schools and/or participate in various tournaments?

Sorry for any mistake, English is not my first language. I also edited the post because my question was not clear to many.  Apologies for that! 

I have been invited to a job interview (postdoctoral position) and while I prepare I  would like to know more about HR practices at the university. I am basically interested in knowing what guidelines do hiring committees follow to avoid biases, etc. 

To clarify, I ask this question because I am curious about the process and I have limited knowledge about the job market and practices  in the US. I do not mean in any way that the university discriminates any group etc. 

I had several interviews in Europe, and also participated in hiring committees. In my experience there is a lot of variation across countries and institutions hence my interest in understanding more the practices at HU.

I've been doing a lot of thinking for next semester's course load and wanted someone (i.e. upperclassmen) to give their input on how hard they think my imagined course loads would be:

5 course route:

\- LS50b (counts as two courses)

\- Spanish 50

\- Expos 20 (unsure of which one yet)

\- Either Psych 16 (Developmental Psychology) or Psych 2485 (Bad Genes, Bad Parents, Bad Behavior - criminality and psychopathy class)

6 course route: 

\- Same as above but I would take both Psych 16 and Psych 2485 instead of choosing between the two. 

For context, this past semester I took LS50a, Psych 18 (Abnormal Psychology), and Spanish 40. Initially, I wasn't planning on taking Psych 2485, but since it'll be Buckholtz's last semester at Harvard, I really wanted to take another class with them since they were a phenomenal professor in Psych 18 and they made psychopathy sound like a really cool topic to study. However, I also really want to do Psych 16 next semester and so I'm torn and don't really want to have to make a choice between the two (especially since my 4 year plan is looking super packed already and I don't want to delay Psych 16).

tl;dr: 5 course route (two pset classes, expos, spanish, one psych course) or 6 course route (two pset classes, expos, spanish, two psych courses)?

I was introduced to my ancestry this summer and I came to learn many interesting things, one of which being that there was a lineage of Harvard and Yale graduates. This was indeed a long time ago; the first of my ancestors to graduate Harvard was in 1693, followed by two of his sons in 1722 and 1725, and one graduating Yale in 1735. In addition, there was also a very close association between my family and the first overseer of Harvard that spans from the founding of the college in 1636. I came to discover this information through various published accounts of New England's history.

My ancestors later emigrated and founded a town in Canada sometime amidst the American Revolution. Growing up, no one in my family ever taught me about the storyline of our ancestry. I suspect that they, for the most part, had no knowledge of any of this. My family did and still does have traditions around being loyal Bruins and Red Sox fans, although for reasons they never quite knew why.

While I am not looking to be admitted into either of these schools, I was wondering what legacy implications there could be for my children in the future if they were to choose to pursue studies at either of these institutions. When one declares legacy, is there space to expand on such lineage or is it simply a yes/no box that's ticked? Is legacy only valid if it is related to the school that one's parent(s) attended?

Hoping to receive some perspective on this matter from the current Harvard community.

People are already talking about internships they have lined up for the spring or the summer and I really need the money from a spring internship or something, but I keep getting rejected from things. 

I’ve tried research assistantships but I get rejected from those too. After over a year at Harvard, I’m really fucking tired of the rejection and it genuinely feels like I was accepted as a big joke so that they could have someone that other students could compare themselves to when they were feeling down. 

I’ve tried CAMHS too and when they had me wait for over a month to be seen, that felt like another rejection. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m sort of spiraling and I feel like I need something to go right, even something small so I can feel like life is worth living again and that I haven’t damned myself to 4 yrs of misery at Harvard, but I can’t find that thing.

Was just wondering if anyone could provide insight into GSAS life (like maybe how you guys found it different from undergrad, socially and academically) or the MS CSE course (e.g. whether coursemates tend to be close to one another). The social aspect is a big thing for me since colleges in Oxford/Cambridge are pretty tight-knit and you end up making really great friends.

I'd also be keen to learn more about career prospects (particularly investment banking/consulting), as well as the prestige of the MS CSE program. I've heard that master's programs in the US are often seen as cash cows and that undergrads, rather than master's students, are mainly recruited for BB/EB IBD or MBB.

This is as opposed to continuing on as a 4th year undergrad at Oxbridge. Oxbridge undergrad is seen as the most prestigious thing you can do in Europe - for example, MBB in London almost exclusively recruit from Oxbridge undergrad - so from a practical standpoint, would it just make more sense to stay in the UK?

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person and any usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me.

I've had visitors get right up on me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

People who are not students are hanging around and getting way too close no matter where you are.

Yesterday, I saw a woman let her child **urinate** on the grass in the middle of the Old Yard. Where people (like me) sit and study.

In short - students have a reason to be here - you (random families, tourists, locals who consider Harvard a 'park') **do not**. Not during this semester, I mean.

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

I am not a Harvard student myself, but a few things here confused me, and I was wondering whether anyone here would have insight into *why* some survey results are... the way they are.

• The number of students with an income of 500K+ seemed to hang around 13-14% for the classes of 2017/18, 15% for 2019/20, and 17% for 2021/22 (the class of 2023 had a “prefer not to say” option. Is this just inflation, is this trend insignificant, or is the number of ultra-rich students slowly creeping up?


• In the classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019, the % Jewish was 9.5, 9.8, and 10.1 respectively. Since then, it has not exceeded 7.7, with a new low of 5.3 for the class of 2023 (2022 was 5.4%). Is this response bias, or are fewer Jews matriculating?

• In the classes of 2017 and 2018, 12.5 and 12.8% of students had received mental health counseling. This number has crept up through the high-teens, and is now at 25.3% for the class of 2023, up from 21.8% for the class of 2022. Is this because of greater access to therapy, admissions changes, or a general societal trend?

• Most “National Politics” questions were “culture war” related, with some being *extremely*  niche. Why are there questions on transgender individuals in the military and separation of families at the border, but not a *single* question on education, healthcare, or economics? These are generally considered (along with climate change) to be the most mainstream voter issues.

I also wanted to say, the class of 2023 looks *quite* impressive. The whole report is fascinating as well — I am extremely impressed.

0.0,1595626355.0,3.0,harvard,"Alright. Hello people of Harvard Reddit, I have a question regarding these two schools and would like to give a preface for my situation and see what are these two programs.

I'm not really thinking of applying to these schools, more so I am just looking for information that is vague and the program is so new.

Obviously the first thing you do when you decide what master's program is your target is google what schools actually offer the masters. Scrolling down a bit past the ads and the 6th university website listed for Biotech masters was Harvard Extension. I'm here because I clicked on it to see what's up since I clicked the other 5 universities before it.

The whole process of earning admission with classes is pretty strange to me, but it seems interesting. Except I only heard of Harvard Extension prior for being a school of Ivy Rejects (it's quite a foul name), so is this program even worth the time, effort, and money for a Harvard University degree: Master of Liberal Arts (ALM) in Extension Studies, field: Biotechnology. (Copy pasted from the website.)

Seemed strange so I did look into the school a little more out of curiosity to see if they offer another ms in biotech (curiosity because of the strangeness), short answer yes but you have to take it with the MBA. Why? I mean sure I probably wouldn't get in with my GPA but if someone who really just wants the MS from Harvard in Biotech, why is it combined?  I looked a little further and even if you get denied by the dual program you can still get into the MBA program only, but not the MS program only? This approach for the degrees in biotech from Harvard's graduate programs seems strange so I was hoping for some clarification since I can't find much on MS/MBA program (it started in 2019 and has 1 page of info...).

Thanks to anyone who replies. I've never really seen programs like these so I'm hoping for some insight on why it's like this.",Biotechnology: Harvard Extension School vs Harvard Business School,t3_hxajyv,3.0,0.64,collegestudentBS

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

Removed | Not Removed
---|---
[Exhibit A](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bjbaqy/about_to_be_a_graduate_from_hes_with_extension/) | [Exhibit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/admddj/hes_what_time_are_grades_posted/) 
[Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5ji6qb/can_i_tell_my_friends_i_go_to_harvard_if_its_hes/) | [Exhibit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/aixskc/hes_alb_acronym_history/)
[Exhibit C](https://reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/4i9dj4/harvard_extension_schoolbad_rep/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi60_eju97qAhVJ5awKHUwKA1MQFjACegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jG4m3obD13F7ucQU3j9FV) | [Exhibit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/92d6t7/my_harvard_email_not_deleted_after_my_class_at/)

I hope the distinction is clear from these examples. If not, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain further. 

---

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

0.0,1595165869.0,56.0,harvard,"Two years ago. I applied early action, never expected to get in, but when I did, I then immediately accepted my offer - because it's Harvard. I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action. Maybe I'm desperate to not be completely miserable, but can someone give me a reason as to why Harvard is the right choice over these other schools?

Although the first rule is very clear, one third to one half of the posts in the sub are about admissions.

Seeing other subs that deal with similar problems, I have two proposals:

1. Get Automoderator to comment on posts with keywords such as ""admissions"", ""alumni"", ""waitlist"" ""transfer"". The comment can remind them the first rule. This way, they are likely to read the rule and remove the post if appropriate;                              or,
2. Require posts including these keywords  to go through moderator approval. As things stand now, mods have to go through them anyway because they get reported.

This is the highest democratically elected Alumni board at Harvard and they have been filled with HAA selected alumni for a long long long time. So a group called Harvard Forward is working to democratically elect 5 candidates to the Board of Overseers to move Harvard forward (get it?) on divesting from fossil fuels, committing more resources to climate-focused initiatives, including recent alumni into our governance, and giving a greater voice to students. 

One of the candidates (John Beatty) is a friend from my time at Harvard's Environmental Action Committee so I can attest that this group is filled with super-stars. 

**Harvard Forward Five for Overseers**: Margaret ""Midge"" Purce, Jayson Toweh, Lisa Bi Huang, John Beatty, Thea Sebastian 

**Endorsed HAA Directors (choose 6 of 7):**

A little about Harvard Forward: 

 **We recognize that there are many things happening in the world right now that need your attention.** The coronavirus pandemic is ongoing, and the Black Lives Matter movement still needs our unfailing support and attention. Many Harvard affiliates have stepped up in the fight to create a more just society and to support those who are suffering. Now it is time for Harvard, as an institution, to follow in their footsteps and take up the mantle of moral leadership and decisive action.   


The Harvard Forward candidates aren't just running on a platform of climate action, responsible investing, and inclusive governance. **They're running to send a message that alumni demand better than the status quo**; that alumni are looking to Harvard to take a stance on the critical issues that are directly threatening the wellbeing and existence of current and future generations.  


**This means addressing not just climate change but also systemic racism**, and Harvard Forward is committed to making anti-racism a larger part of our platform. We're currently reaching out to those in the Harvard community who are leading anti-racism organizing to find out how we can best support their efforts, and we'll share our progress with you as it develops.

Last August, in a lawsuit brought by fraternities and sororities to challenge the policy, Judge Gorton of the United States District Court in Boston denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the case. In essence, the court accepted the plaintiffs’ legal theory that the policy, although adopted to counteract discrimination based on sex, is itself an instance of discrimination based on sex. The court reasoned that the policy applies to men but not women who seek to join all-male social organizations and applies to women but not men who seek to join all-female social organizations, and that this constitutes sex discrimination under federal law. In reaching this view, Judge Gorton relied heavily on the reasoning in one of the appellate decisions (Zarda v. Altitude Express) that was affirmed by the Supreme Court. It now seems clear that Judge Gorton would ultimately grant judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor in the pending lawsuit and that Harvard would be legally barred from further enforcing the policy. 

In view of the Supreme Court’s decision, following Judge Gorton’s prior opinion in the lawsuit against Harvard, the Corporation consulted with the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Dean of Harvard College, and the University’s General Counsel last week. We together came to the view that, in the circumstances, the College will not be able to carry forward with the existing policy under the prevailing interpretation of federal law. As a result, following a vote of the Corporation on Friday to rescind its prior approval, the policy will no longer be enforced.",Sanctions against final clubs were just lifted,t3_hi98yi,11.0,0.74,KantianCant

A few things I wanted to get advice on: 
- is an Ed.M worth it? For background, I went to a top 20 school and studied business and education. Hoping to maybe go into education consulting after this 
- how much can I expect to pay? They’re not reducing tuition fees, so I’m wondering about the typical fin aid given by Harvard and how much I will need to budget/take out in loans 
- what are some downsides to this program being online? Time will tell, but I’m interested in hearing if people think this format will decrease the value of the program? 
- planning to keep my FT job and also do the program FT. Big commitment, I know. Would appreciate any insight on this

Linear algebra, really? It doesn't get much easier than this. y = mx +b, come on, that's baby shit. This is just like learning what lines are, the only tricky part is now they call them vectors––big whoop. 

3. Applied Math 22a

coming in at just 8 hours of work per week according to the Q guide this is like linear algebra but, like, applied, sounds easy to me. The prof uses the word ""gentle"" in the course description, it doesn't get much easier than that.

1.Math 55a 

""Studies in algebra and group theory""?  Your biggest challenge in this course will be trying to remember the basic algebra you learned in like 6th grade. The group theory portion? The perfect prep for blocking groups.

Founded in Harvard earlier this year, [Students vs Pandemics](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/20/harvard-student-pandemic-group/) is an interdisciplinary group of grad and undergrad students building community and empowering students to make a positive impact on health and overall wellness during times of crisis. Our three primary goals are to improve transparency and communication, build community, and identify needs and innovate solutions. We share health education material, resources for students, and opportunities to serve our greater community through our[ resources spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTerz_XiSYghoEMn01biDnqqBM_pQIa3S8o-BhEKy-s/edit#gid=531738015) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studentsvspandemics/), write policy memos for state legislators, organize virtual COVID hackathons, address the digital disparity, and launch other initiatives. SvP gained over 100 volunteer members within a week of its launch and is now there are over 370 members from different chapters all over the country (more chapters oversea are being built!)

We are constantly looking for experts in all fields. As we know, we are in a huge public health crisis from COVID-19 and systemic racism; and interdisciplinary efforts are needed more than ever. We are also listening to community needs to tailor our efforts to better help the community (so if you have any feedback or concerns about a certain topic during this crisis, don't hesitate to contact us).

Now that 6 grad schools are officially going online for the Fall international students have been advised to not move to the US until in-person classes restart.

I'm an incoming freshman at Harvard, and have been doing research into whether any of my AP credit will be transferable. On the Advanced Standing portal of the Undergraduate website, there have been some changes listed to Harvard's system for the Class of 2024, namely that...

&gt;Admitted students who enter the College as freshmen in Fall 2020 (the Class of 2024), and all subsequent classes, will not be eligible to receive Harvard College degree credit for pre-matriculation credentials earned in secondary school. This means that Advanced Placement examinations, the International Baccalaureate diploma, and international credentials will no longer be recognized for Harvard College credit toward the degree beginning with the students who enter the College in Fall 2020. These examinations will continue to serve as valuable placement tools, and certain examinations may still fulfill the College’s language requirement.

Do you know if it's still required to send Harvard the scores for this year? I'm losing a little bit of motivation to still study these next few weeks now that the scores won't be accepted for credit. If a student were to fail his or her AP exams, would that be grounds to possibly rescind them? Is there a way to still cancel planned AP exams before taking them? Do you know if matriculating students are required to send AP exam scores or can you choose not to?

Sorry if there are obvious answers to these questions, and thanks so much for any feedback in advance!

With everything going on, I completely understand any guesses at this point are pure speculation. But, I suspect some of you are substantially more informed on this than me. I know Harvard accepted 30 more people this year (1980) to maybe account for any covid-19 related deferrals or offer refusals. My question is how much will those 30 more admitted students affect the usage of the waitlist this year. 

Last year, 65 people were accepted off the waitlist. Any chance that number will be higher this year. And if so, how much so? Something interesting to note is that school who historically haven't utilized waitlist at all like Princeton and Dartmouth started to pull from the waitlist before May 1. And, UPenn dean of admissions openly announced, a few days after ivy day, that he predicted they would heavily use the waitlist this year. Granted, these schools don't have the yield Harvard has historically had, but its still weird how they resorted to the waitlist that early when they haven't admitted anyone off it in years past.

I'm a recent 2024 admit torn between Harvard and Stanford for CS. A pull for H seems to be its overall intellectual development with the breadth of studies and diversity of student interests.

I'm wondering whether the gen-eds, freshman seminars, and divisional distributions actually end up contributing to intellectual development and whether they really teach you how to think. Or are they mostly BS? Do they just become a burden in the way of your concentration courses? Do you find value in taking them and being surrounded by students with many different interests?

I guess I'm trying to reconcile the merits of liberal arts vs vocational training. I would love to hear your thoughts.

Personally, I've wanted to maintain some type of connection, but life as an adult gets busy and complicated, and I often find that it gets bumped lower on the list of life's priorities.  I did alumni interviewing for some years, and found it rewarding to help out and to represent Harvard to applicants.  When I was back in the area, I reached out to a few student groups and did a few talks about the premed process.  I went to a few groups' meetings, but didn't keep that up.  I've been somewhat wary of official alumni association things, as my family's experiences with respect to spam, etc. has not been good.


I've thought about reaching out again to undergrads to pay forward some experience and see how I can help--even perhaps inconsequential stuff like bringing some people on a a Costco run for their suitemates--or informal advising, but am not sure how much anyone would want that kind of assistance or interaction.

Harvard PROs: 

- social atmosphere

- grade inflation/ higher avg gpa(i might want to go onto business school later on + Harvard likely has more connections)

- it’s harvard (world wide prestige — kind of a dream school for me)

Harvard cons: 

- their cs department isn’t on the same level as MIT

- maybe less opportunities for cs internships, since Harvard seems to be leaning more liberal arts

MIT PROS: 

-strong cs dept

- collaborative culture

MIT CONS: 

- too geeky/nerdy 

- difficult (lower avg gpa)

- maybe more competitive for CS internships since like 1/2 the people major in CS

Everyone's been thrown into the virtual learning realm quite suddenly which doesn't help given everything else happening. Too much to process. 

More Qs: are all the College classes just pre-recorded or is there a live Zoom component? I'm also curious, is there a difference in perspective amongst grad students, mid-career grads and college students?

I'm a grad student and absolutely love learning online. Most grad students have also spent time working and learning to delineate between work, school and leisure - a learned bevavior that quickly becomes important. One of the reasons it works from me, aside from my learning style, is the flexibility it affords my work. I've lived in three countries this last year, mostly for work, and am able to continue my classes uninterrupted. I especially appreciate the live Zoom classes and the interaction with other students. I don't think that'd make a world of a difference if it was in person (unless we're looking to make friends - but even then, I remain in touch with quite a few students post-semester.)

Initially, I thought it was going to be a breeze since I worked during undergrad and managed well; but, online learning requires a new type of discipline that took months to cultivate. (I saved my in class needs for learning languages but also transitioned those to online format once I left the country.) Making that transition isn't easy but can be rewarding.

I recently got into Harvard and Yale. I can't go to any admit days because of the current global health situation. I would appreciate it if you could allow me to gain a better insight into your institution. (I'm from Dallas, TX if that makes any difference lol).

I intend to do bioengineering/biomedical engineering on a pre-med track and go to medical school after graduation. I want a school with good pre-med experience and generally good advising. I want to be heavily involved in research during undergrad, and I want to be able to form connections with my professors. I just want a campus with friendly faces, with a lot of clubs I can become involved in.

I'm also interested in film and art as hobbies and I have a wide array of interests I'd like to pursue in college. I love to write and that's also something I'd like to do (i.e. I'd like to perhaps get involved at a school publication). I want a school that would allow me to pursue these hobbies as well as allow me to build a solid pre-professional experience.

I really want to know what Harvard's environment is like. Do you feel it is as cutthroat and competitive as many say it is? If someone looks lost on campus, will someone typically approach them to help? Are people friendly? I would appreciate your honest opinions!

0.0,1584027182.0,25.0,harvard,"Hello friends,

Harvard's history is marked with numerous occasions when crisis lead to momentous change for the University's constituent schools. The most notable of these events for the purpose of my post is how Radcliffe Women began attending lectures with men only when male attendance dropped during the Second World War. Now is such a moment for the Extension School. 

Once we have contained or survived the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus (and we will survive), all members of the Harvard community should note how much of a resource the Extension School is for the entire university. Not only has it be tacitly (and intently) preparing for widespread distance education for generations, it also provides the University with insight and a diversity of perspectives the University would not have otherwise. 

Furthermore, HES reaches some of the poorest, and most disadvantaged people affiliated with the University. Presidents Faust and Bacow have discussed how Harvard needs to use its ""greatness"" to do more ""good"". Well... HES has been at the forefront of this goal since 1909.

While most people in r/Harvard may demand for the ""In Extension Studies"" tag to be removed from diplomas, I suggest 3 other reforms that will integrate HES more with the broader Harvard community.

1) Open University Apartment Housing up to HES degree students, at least undergrads. Students in Columbia's undergraduate parallel to HES, the School of General Studies (GS), are allowed to enter the housing lottery for their version of University Apartment Housing.

2) Allow HES degree candidates to enroll directly for all FAS classes (prerequisites permitting). Again, Columbia already does this which results in more veterans, mothers, minorities, and professional artists in their classes.

3) Seek donations for (or just build with the \~$40B endowment) a ""House"" for extension programs. This house can rent out rooms to students visiting for on-campus weekends, or to full time students taking all their courses on-campus. It also would give the Extension School a more visible presence on campus, and a new permanent home for a revived Grossman Library. (As an urban planner, I think the Church St. parking lot would be a great place for an ""Extension House"".)

I hope some of you agree with this assessment. Harvard's response to the coronavirus opens a door for HES to ascend to a place within the University it already should hold. I encourage everyone to email the school, the University, and any professor they know to highlight the importance of the Extension School for the entire University. The coronavirus may linger, but it will become old news as quickly as it became a pandemic. Its legacy must be used to improve the University, and one way this can be accomplished is to support the Extension School, and its degree students as much as any other degree candidate.",A Pivotal Moment for the Extension School,t3_fhi4x4,25.0,0.89,montym

It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&amp;adults=1&amp;check_in=2020-04-22&amp;check_out=2020-04-30&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from.

As I am walking from to Sever I hear a guy behind me say ""help a veteran get something to eat."" I turn around and I see a middle aged black gentleman in a wheelchair. 

I pull the Cliff bar out of my pocket and I asked him, ""Hey man I just bought this, do you want it?"" 

He looks at the bar and asks, ""Is it gluten free?"" 

I start looking at the back of the package and say ""I dunno man, I don't think so."" 

He, casually replies, ""Don't worry about it then."" 

I can't stop thinking about this interaction, so much about it was so weird. If I was homeless and asking for food I would definitely say that I had celiac's or gluten sensitivity for turning the food down. He didn't, is no gluten a preference for him? Does he have a gluten allergy? Is he in cahoots with the ""homeless vegetarian"" woman in front of CVS? 

I fully acknowledge that this man is a human being and has the absolute right to turn down my food if he doesn't want it. That being said, it was really disarming to try and give food to this go and be told no. More so, the way he told me no was so condescending.

0.0,1581641533.0,33.0,harvard,"As I stood in the mirror last night and admitted to myself that I wanted to declare econ I mentally prepared myself for the onslaught that living my truth as a lover of economics would entail. 

I first want to say that declaring econ is not a choice, I didn't wake up one day and decide ""I want to pick the most popular concentration that offers some of the most lucrative job opportunities after graduation"",  I woke up one morning clutching a copy of Wealth of Nations and blabbering to my roommate about reverse causality. 

To some of you it may seem like I am equating the struggle of being an ec concentrator with that of LGBTQ Americans, and you would be right, that's exactly what I am doing (because this is satire). Some would say that the backlash ec conentators face is actually more nefarious than regular-ol homophobia; I think much of the hatred of econ is based in the view that it is twinged with pre-professionalism and that students in the field  have merely forgone Harvard's fantastic academic opportunities to study something that will get them a job at Goldman. Regardless of whether or not that is true, the notion that Harvard students should not focus on finding a job and making money post grad has undertones of a quiet privilege, deaf to students from economically insecure backgrounds who do not feel they have the luxury of entering the job market without classically marketable job skills, and inconsiderate of other colleges and universities that serve merely as engines of economic mobility and not academic playgrounds. 

This is not to say that every hist and lit concentrator is some trust fund baby and every econ concentrator is a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who wants to work in investment banking to support his or her family, far from it, this is merely to say we would be remiss if we did not examine the ways in which class, privilege, and economic security permeate our decisions to come to Harvard and how we decide to spend our time while we are here.

My current interest is in international affairs, and as of now I envision my career path as something in that field, whether it be working for the government or a think tank/NGO or something like that. 

Going in, I have a relatively firm belief that my primary concentration will be Government, but I’m undecided on whether or not I want my secondary field to be in East Asian Studies or German.  I feel somewhat compelled to worry about this now because I saw that I would have to be fluent in either language (Mandarin or German) in order to take advantage of study abroad in those areas, as well as taking advantage of internships/work abroad, so I’ll have to learn the language prior to junior year I think. If this is wrong, or if this is something y’all think my academic advisor or someone like that can help me with in time, please let me know. 

My justification for studying German is that I have a deep love of German culture and history, and the idea of studying abroad in any German speaking country appeals to me. Also, if at some point in my career I have to work abroad, I’d rather be living in Germany/Austria/Switzerland/some German speaking country rather than China. Also, Germany being arguably the most important country in Europe, I think it will have use. 

My justification for studying Mandarin is that I find Sino-American relations extremely interesting from the policy perspective, and I think that it’ll become the most important country America has relations with, so studying Mandarin will bear the most fruit. My current conception is that living in China if I must would not be that nice (at least compared to German-speaking nations), but please tell me if that conception is wrong. 

I’m kinda torn, so guidance would be appreciated.

However after using the app myself, I found that the frontend design is very unattractive and makes it really hard to schedule/enter availabilities on mobile.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people’s availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of college students to the platform and it has been working great so far. I think that it would definitely be a very useful tool for Harvard student orgs.

&gt;On November 27, 2019, Harvard University denied tenure to an ethnic-studies professor specializing in Dominican identity. Students and faculty at Harvard and across the country sprung into protest mode. The failure to tenure Lorgia García Peña, they said, resulted from Harvard’s racism. NBC Nightly News, the *New York Times*, the *Boston Globe*, and other outlets covered the controversy from the same angle.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, García Peña had been catapulted into the academic firmament with a speed that most non-intersectional professors can only dream of. She has been showered with benefits. Thirty-one percent of Harvard’s tenure-track professors lost their tenure bids in the 2018‒19 academic year without alleging bias, since most of those failed contenders were white. Yet García Peña has gone through her academic career playing the victim, reflexively accusing those around her of white supremacy. In this, she is a perfect synecdoche for ethnic studies itself, which also stakes its identity on the conceit that it is in a nonstop battle for survival against the forces of racism and exclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;To the contrary, ethnic studies is ascendant. It is spreading rapidly throughout K‒12 schools; its ideology has already bled into the political realm. It’s worth reviewing García Peña’s career as an emblem of a fast-rising academic field whose worldview is taking over American culture.",Ethnic Studies 101: Playing the Victim.

0.0,1578965509.0,43.0,harvard,"Last semester was overall a really good one for me. I met so many great people, and I am grateful I was able to so quickly find a niche at the big bustling nerve-wracking world of Harvard.

A big part of that was thanks to the Harvard Crimson, which was far more welcoming and accepting than I could have hoped for. It's truly such a great organization. Its comp process was long and challenging, but my comp directors made the experience completely manageable, light-hearted, and fun. We got to publish multiple articles and benefitted from the experience and expertise of thoughtful, wise editors.

So the Crimson-ICE controversy absolutely broke my heart. On multiple occasions, it brought me to tears. I am a sensitive person, and I try my best to be a moral person. I'm quite left-wing, and strongly support abolish ICE, the decriminalization of immigration, and taking in as many refugees as possible.

And yet I can't escape a simple, clear conviction I have come to: The Crimson was in the right, Act on a Dream in the wrong.

Act on a Dream was absolutely unreasonable in their demands and thoughtless in their actions. The main purpose of a public protest is to demonstrate public support for a cause. The free press has an obligation to scrutinize and duly report on protests, which benefits just social movements by spreading their message and reach. Reaching out to a government agency for comment is never an endorsement of said agencies' actions, nor does it inherently put students in danger. If ICE wanted to prey on undocumented students at Harvard, they would do so regardless of if a comment is asked. ICE's non-comment on the article is demonstrative of their uncaring attitudes to the lives of this country's many brilliant and brave undocumented students. Therefore, the Crimson, without resorting to biased reporting, was able to demonstrate the strength and moral conviction of the Abolish ICE movement in Harvard's community.

Then, Act on a Dream threw that all away by attacking the Crimson for conducting a routine component of journalism. The boycott by various Harvard student groups only did three things: ensure that their efforts and movements would not be reported on with their voice accounted for, cause people both in and outside of the Harvard community to think less of these vital causes, and spread misinformation about the actions and the nature of the Crimson as an organization. I've talked to many students, all otherwise smart and lovely people, who had completely warped views of the situation. Some thought the Crimson literally gave ICE the names of undocumented students, or that we collaborated with them to undermine the protest. I heard people talking about vandalizing the Crimson's headquarters. When people don't trust the Crimson, they will have trouble gaining a full, nuanced perspective on complex campus issues.

Student activists have wasted so much time and effort attacking their fellow students, and allies in making Harvard a fair and just community. It makes me so upset the wasted potential this unnecessary conflict created.

I want us all to move on

So, as an anonymous internet person, I hope that we all can find peace and cooperation in the next semester. I hereby give full, unconditional forgiveness to the people who have slandered my peers, and caused the national press to ridicule the Harvard activist community. I love you all, and I know most of you are good people.

If you want to make a difference on campus, one of the best ways is to comp the Crimson this coming semester. We have a generous financial aid program and do not cut anyone during the comp. All are welcome. Love and mercy everyone.",Harvard Crimson,t3_eoe0uq,43.0,0.87,MongolianBotanist

I don’t want to be rude or call anyone out, but I’m afraid of Harvard’s social sphere. A fair share of posts in this subreddit are about how lonely and sad Harvard students feel, the lack of a dating life, and so on. This just kinda worries me a bit. I kinda hoped getting into Harvard was like this golden ticket and life would be all butterflies and rainbows after I started college. Obviously, this was super naive, but now it seems like it might even be the opposite. I already struggle with sadness and loneliness right now and I’d hate for college to amplify them. 

I’m already somewhat introverted. In high school, I finally made some solid friends, but it took until senior year for me to find them.  I’m afraid that finding friends at Harvard might take too long. I wish I thought of this earlier because by now it’s too late to apply to other schools, specifically MIT. MIT seems like it might be a better fit for me (I want to study comp sci and am pretty nerdy in liking engineering), but the all-nighter horror stories and my annoying mit tour guide scared me away from applying, which I now sincerely regret. MIT seems to have a ton of sciencey, nerdy people that I get along well with. So far all the Harvard people I met are super into social justice, liberal arts, and debating, which is fine and cool, but not really the kind of people I associate with.

Also, a minor point about the people, everyone seems to be way more accomplished than me by just looking at their Instagram pages. Imposter syndrome is already coming in hot :(

Finally, sports are a minor issue I have about Harvard. I was hoping to play my sport at Harvard, but even if I could play, the D1 level of athletics seems very hard core and I don’t know if I could handle it, if even afforded the opportunity. I am aware of club options, but I don’t know much about it. 

I should also state that I am still almost certainly coming to Harvard. I didn’t really apply to any school that I would choose over Harvard. I really just want to know how I can make sure the social life goes well for me. I realize that it might be early to start worrying about this since I haven’t even been at Harvard for one day, but I’d rather be prepared for the worst. Thanks

TLDR: I am going to Harvard in the fall, but I’m afraid that a sciencey introvert like me will have trouble making friends, dating, and not getting depressed. It might be early to worry about this, but I’d like to know about all I can in advance.

I feel like Harvard's system with blocking groups makes it absolutely impossible for me to find a new friend group to be a part of. Also, I feel like most ""groups"" don't want to include other people because they have their specific closed off group dynamic. Should I just give up all together on trying to find a friend group at this point? It would be nice to have that because right now all of my friends are individual and it gets really lonely.",Finding a Friend Group,t3_eiph1w,3.0,0.67,throwawayhopeful2

I know this sub gets tons of posts just like this, and right now is probably prime time as we’re all reeling from the semester and getting back long-anticipated grades. I’ve spent tons of time brooding these thoughts, and hesitating to post because we’ve all heard this story before, but idk man, I really want these feelings off my chest. Either way I really am sorry in advance for the ranty long post ahead.

It’s 11:22 pm on the 31st and I’m unironically sitting in my bed in my dead quiet house while the rest of the world is celebrating New Years’ Eve. It’s not that I didn’t want to party. I just didn’t get invited anywhere. It’s given me even more time to ruminate than was already unhealthy, and now all the bad thoughts are just melting together and really letting me have it.
 
My first semester kind of sucked. I know it wasn’t the worst it possibly could have been, but it sure wasn’t good. Now I know this is pretty normal, but so many things that were bad about it are part of broader problems, and I know they won’t just magically resolve themselves. I feel really angry lately, which is just an intensification of previous, constant feelings of sadness, emptiness, paranoia and self-blame that have stretched back since early in high school. When I have memories about the semester, if I close my eyes and re-envision my state of mind when I had time to think— on those routine walks to/from the dhall, to class, wherever— with minimal exception, I could only ever recall feeling angry, sad, or just nothing. It was constant by around the second week of classes. Feeling nothing but either distinctly bad, or just nothing. Just flat. And that flat feeling wasn’t much better than bad, because it would devolve into bad at the drop of a hat. The same didn’t go for good; something cool could happen, and I could feel relaxed for once, but the bad ruminations and mean inner criticisms would crowd out those feelings so quickly that I look back and hardly remember the good times even happened. By the end of the semester I felt like I was slowly losing my spirit. Just fading into something vaguer and vaguer every day. I felt like who I was there was just some even worse, even less likable version of whatever confused sad thing I was before.

My approach to these feelings this semester was mostly to isolate myself when I got into a really negative spiral, which ended up being pretty often after the first few weeks. I would avoid developing my friendships, not because I didn’t want to have friends, but because despite my efforts to cheer up, it was honestly really, really difficult to not appear cold and dismissive and terse in conversation even though none of that had a single thing to do with the other person. It’s not that I turned into an absolute asshat during those moods, or was explicitly mean, and it’s certainly not that I never talked to people. I really did have a some normal, good days, some great meals where I felt just fine and slipped back into my sort of funny, chill self. It’s just that I didn’t do it enough, and now I’m worried the withdrawn brooding side is all some people might remember. I could have done so much better. I just gave up and withdrew into myself too many times in the dhall or in classes or meetings with my EC. I could have done so much better. Not that I even know how to manage it, but I could have tried harder. I’m really concerned about the long-term effects of that behavior on my future ability to make friends here, because I’m paranoid that people have an image of me as this angry loner. Maybe kind of irrational, maybe not. I’m just angry at myself I let that side come out so often. We’re all people, we all get angry. Come on verisad, you’re supposed to develop methods to control yourself when you’re an adult. I’ve done a shit job with that. I shouldn’t have let it get this out of hand.

I’m just really disgusted with myself. I feel like that’s the best way I could describe it sometimes. Like when I kind of step outside myself, and look inward, I kind of cringe, because ew, look at me. I’m not performing particularly well at school (and know a few of my peers did consistently better, plus were good wholesome people, so the ‘it’s only first semester’ stuff is not really a tenable excuse), I have no friends, my jokes aren’t really that funny, I’m kind of weird and tryhard and awkward. Any people I met in the dhall, at my main EC, that I SHOULD have pursued friendships with, I either only half did, or just didn’t, because I guess I couldn’t deal with the effort of following it up, or just couldn’t reign in my emotions. I’ve even gained fifteen pounds, so when I’m not degrading myself in my head for whatever reason, no worries, I could always just look at my body and be fucking disgusted all over again. I came home thinking maybe being away from Annenberg would help me at least begin shedding the weight, slowly, since we generally don’t keep excess food in the house . . . nope, no change. And too bad the iota of motivation I actually did have to go work out in the beginning of the semester, when I got myself to the gym a few times, has totally burnt out.

I know we all have a mean inner critical voice and this is it talking. But the thing is, I feel like when we tend to say things like ‘don’t listen to the critical inner voice, because it’s irrational,’ my problem with that is that I feel like mine is, actually, pretty ‘rational’. I really do seem to deserve some, if not most, of the self-criticism. My personality is lacking somewhere. Not to make this about logic or anything, but it’s the inference to the best explanation. Take the real-life evidence, I don’t have friends. I’m not getting hit up. Never dated anyone. I’m a lonely person. I am capable of being outgoing and somewhat funny, but somewhere along the way the motor just burns out and somehow I can’t make and keep friends. I’m not extremely desirable friend or partner material, and I am doing this to myself, and am not getting better at not doing it to myself. 

I know it can change. Anything can change. It could get better, sure. Then it could get worse again. I told myself that things would change for the better in high school, and senior year — forget it, after Dec. 13th I thought I was holding that golden ticket, finally on my way to feeling ‘normal’ and fulfilled and with my own crowd. I remember the fever of the holidays. I binged the housing day videos when they came out, memorized all the flags and mascots. I watched that Adams rap video one in awe, feeling all fuzzy, like I was in on this special inside joke now. Well surprise, reversal of fortune, now who even knows if I’ll have a blocking group. I’ll have less than a month to figure it out. I just wish I gave it a little more effort. I couldn’t just suck it up and get back on the horse. That’s what life is about, getting back on the horse. And I couldn’t do it, and I don't know how to get better at doing it. I wish I could sorry to any person I was ever unfairly dismissive toward. I just want them to know how sorry I am, and that it wasn't their fault. It's also absolutely awful to consider the possibility that I could have contributed to even more bad feelings in others when I acted like that, and just continued the cycle and made it worse for everyone and helped screw over the aggregate pleasure, even if just a little. If anyone our there ever had someone just act mad around you for no reason, I'm sorry on their behalf. Maybe it was me. You didn't deserve that.

If anyone else had similar feelings first semester and wants to share any insight, I would really appreciate it. I'm currently talking to someone at CAMHS, and having some sort of evaluation soon where I guess they determine whether I should get on meds. That's kind of worrisome in its own right because my parents' divorce is leaving my mom in a really awful financial situation, and getting outside treatment is costly and I don't even want to think about stressing her out more, but we'll see. If anyone found other ways of coping that helped in the first year, it would mean a lot. 

I’m sorry this was a dump. If it’s too rambling, I’m sorry, delete it, or I will. I know it’s like anything else we all see and hear about here, but I seriously have nowhere else to put down these feelings. I hope everyone on this sub has a great New Years. You all work so hard and deserve the best. Whoever you are, I seriously hope you could find some solace from whatever you’re going through right now. I’m sure we could all use that right now.

I am a student from Southern California who will be moving (with a car) to Cambridge in August 2020 to start a masters program at Harvard. Disclaimer: I have read all posts I could find on this topic, but all of them seem to discourage car ownership by Harvard students as opposed to providing actual practical advice.

So with that said, could any fellow crazy car owners please share their thoughts or point me in the right direction? I am particularly interested in the following:

* What is the average cost for an off-street parking spot in Cambridge? Any recommended companies/landlords?
* If I am staying for 1 year, will I likely get busted for having out of state plates? According to the MA laws I read, there is no grace period to register your vehicle once you are an MA resident. That is in theory, how is it in practice?
* Is it easy to obtain a student parking permit? Are the garages fairly secure? How hard is it to find a space, typically?

So, idk if this is the right spot for this, but here goes:

This is my first semester (I’m a first-year) and it’s been the most miserable few months of my life. Every day I’ve been here I’ve just been sad. I know I’m clinically depressed and all that stuff, but I’ve never been this bad to the point where–now that I’ve got to take finals–I just want to curl up and die somewhere. 


Socially, I had a group for a little bit but there was a bit of a falling out–it wasn’t really anyone’s fault, but it was enough for me to distance myself and so I lost any sense of social belonging earlier in the semester. In terms of clubs, it’s just been a steady stream of rejections. And in terms of academics, I push myself so damn hard and I still get really shitty grades and I’m probably going to just end up with all Cs and maybe a B if I’m lucky. I just feel really inadequate all the time and everyone is always talking about grade inflation and complains about their A- or whatever, meanwhile I’m literally at the bottom of all my classes and I kind of just want to die because of it. I did go to a kind of shitty public school where I didn’t have to try very hard in general, but I’ve always pushed myself and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to fix anything in any aspect of my life and it’s been so incredibly frustrating. My finals have all been ass, even though I’ve given up what little time I made for myself to throw myself 100% into preparing for them. 

I tried to convince myself that, at the very least I could do something fun or cool over the summer because Harvard’s name–no matter how much I hate this place and no matter how miserable I’ve been–is powerful enough to open doors. I realize now how misguided that was, because I’m on-track to go home and be depressed for 3 months over summer break and nothing else. Maybe pick up an odd job or two but nothing relevant to my goals. 

I don’t know who to go to for support. CAMHS gave me the option of antidepressants or weird fucking support groups, that I know wouldn’t help me. My parents think that Harvard is the best place on earth and that I’m silly to be so sad while I’m here. I don’t have friends really. I’m just so at my wit’s end. I know it’s only one semester and I’m probably just a whiny idiot for complaining this much, but I really can’t see any way out of this mess. I don’t know if I should consider transferring, and even if I did, I don’t know what school would take my shitty GPA and useless/non-existent extracurriculars. A part of me thought that maybe this was something to discuss with PAFs or my advisor, but it seems like PAFs are just there to cart in food for study breaks and advisors to lift the hold on your account. 

And, even if I do stay at this school, I don’t see how things would be different next semester or the one after that or the one after that. It’s clear that I’m not academically capable enough for this school and there doesn’t seem to be a way for me to fix that. I’m just over everything kind of at this point. Life, Harvard,  everything else. 

I’m on mobile and I have fat fucking fingers so I apologize for any grammatical errors. 

I’d appreciate any advice or something. I don’t know. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I just feel like I need to scream myself hoarse but this the next best thing, I guess.",Shitty Semester?,t3_e9z4g6,34.0,0.94,depressedatharvard

&gt;On Tuesday, December 10, 2019 El Jefe's Taqueria and the Harvard Varsity Club will be sponsoring the 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Fundraiser. For each of the last two years, we've had over 2,000 customers come to El Jefe's on this day and have raised over $27,000 each year. In addition, thousands more donated to the Benson M. Abercrombie ’21 Fund, established by the Harvard Varsity Club. Ben was a freshman at Harvard in Sept 2017 and was a defensive back for the Harvard Crimson Football Team. During Harvard's first game of the 2017 season, Ben suffered a catastrophic cervical neck injury and was paralyzed. What started as a beautiful fall day ended in tragedy for Ben and his family.

&gt;* Facing a lifelong struggle, Ben has worked incredibly hard over the last two years to build his life anew. Remarkably, in August less than two years after his injury, Ben came back to Harvard University and started his freshman year again. Let's let Ben and his family know that the Harvard Square and the Harvard University community continue to support his valiant efforts. Let’s make this 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Day even bigger and better than the first two! There are several ways to help:

&gt;* Come eat at El Jefe’s (83 Mount Auburn Street) on * Tuesday, December 10th from 8 am until 4 am. Every penny that comes in the door that day will go to Ben’s fund. Spread the word and bring your friends! Customers will also be given the opportunity to add additional monies upon check out.

&gt;*  you are unable to eat at the restaurant on the 10th, representatives from the Varsity Club and the Harvard Football Team will be onsite all day collecting credit card and cash donations.

&gt;* Donate online: harvardvarsityclub.org/abercrombiefund

&gt;We encourage you to share this information in order to make this our biggest fundraising total yet! Come by on Tuesday and say hi to Ben. He'll be on site for most of the day.","El Jefe's &amp; Harvard Varsity Club announce 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Fundraiser on Tuesday, 10 December",t3_e71vk0,13.0,1.0,JanetYellensFuckboy

0.0,1569110474.0,43.0,harvard,"Here’s the abstract:

&gt;	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no one’s surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

&gt;	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn’t really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

I was recently looking into Harvard University's Extension School and after chatting with one of the school's academic advisors, I still came away with a few questions that perhaps some of you may have the answers to. I suppose the easiest way to do this is to bullet-point them, so here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

* For the ""Earn-Your-Way-In"" admissions, I was thinking of taking the three suggested courses that are on the Extension School's website (EXPO 15, EXPO 25, and MATH E-3). The advisor I spoke to mentioned that they would count towards the degree itself. Any thoughts on this? How were the courses themselves?
* I noticed that there's an on-campus requirement. How was this for folks? Was it a pain trying to find parking/getting a parking pass from the university? (I live about an hour north of Cambridge in Maine)
* How were the online classes/courses? I'm no stranger to online learning, but I do know that every school has their own ""spin"" when it comes to online education.
* How's financial aid for the Extension School? I noticed that it was mentioned online, and briefly said by the advisor I spoke with, but is it generous (if needed, I would only be taking sixty-four credits for the degree, as I will have sixty-four credits transferring into the program itself; also, I currently have a 3.67 GPA, if that goes into academic scholarship decision-making).
* And lastly, for those of whom who have graduated from this program, is it worth it? I've read other comment sections/blogs/posts where some have had difficulties with their degrees, due to the phrasing of the degree itself (""Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies,"" even though they majored/concentrated in Environmental Studies), and was just wondering if there was any sort of ""stigma"" attached to the degree, or if the majority of what I read was just a bunch of hot air.

0.0,1612387965.0,0.0,princeton,"Hi all,

Princeton has long been my dream school (more precisely, since sophomore year). You will see this reflected in the breakdown of my performance. 

I have a few LD’s, such as a bad case of ADHD and NVLD. I attended a special needs middle school and now attend a small prep school in NYC. Freshman year was challenging, as I was behind on the material and had anxiety from the greater expectations. I caught up over that summer, and perhaps fortuitously visited Princeton then too. I thought it impossible to ever attend, given my poor academic career. Nonetheless, I was inspired by the campus and kept it in mind. I worked diligently in sophomore year, saw significant improvement, and continue to now as a junior. 

One of my concerns lies in the fact that I never enrolled in an AP course. My school offers five across sophomore, junior, and senior years. In sophomore year, I had no chance of enrolling in one given my class trajectory. I applied for them this year, but didn’t get admitted. I was, however, enrolled in two honors courses for the first time. I plan on taking two APs and at least two honors next year as well. Could this “AP” dilemma be explained away, or will it irreparably damage my application? 

I have also heard that Princeton doesn’t consider freshman grades, but they are listed below in case that isn’t true - and for context. 

Anyway, here are my grades, **potential** test scores, extracurriculars, and awards across my three years of high school.


Intended major: Literature

*My school uses the 100 scale for GPA. I will make conversions to the 4.0 scale. 

- 9th grade: 81 GPA (2.7)
- 10th grade: 95 GPA (4.0)
- 11th grade (thus far): 95 GPA (4.0)

Class rank: 19/65 (brought down by 9th grade, would likely be top 10 without it) 

I will be taking the August SAT. My goal is a 1500+, and I intend to spend my breaks and summer studying. I have a private tutor and ample resources to realize this goal. In the event that I don’t, I may go test-optional. 

Current extracurriculars: 

- President and founder of Debate Society
- Editor of and contributor to school literary magazine
- Publisher for school newsletter
- Peer tutor
- Member of history tournament team

Planned additions:

- Debate Society competing in tournament
- Receiving recognition outside of school for literary works (publishing newspaper in local publication, submitting poetry online). 
- Delivering speeches at venues (likely virtual) over summer or in fall

It’s a simple list, I know - but these are the things I chose to do out of genuine passion. I’ve heard that less is more when it comes to EC’s, but please be the judge of that. 

Current awards:

- Deans List for two consecutive years
- Spanish department award (10th grade)
- Science department award (10th grade)

Projected additions: 

- At least two more department awards
- Awards for school extracurriculars (Debate Society tournament, school literary magazine, newsletter)

I don’t believe anyone from my school has been admitted to Princeton - or at least not for many years, but all other Ivies (with the exception of Dartmouth) and other top schools regularly take students from here. It may be because they don’t apply to Princeton (I haven’t heard of anyone doing so). 

I realize a lot of this is hypothetical. But if I do realize these academic goals, would I have a chance at Princeton? I intend to apply restrictive E.A. so they know how strong and personal this desire is. 

Thank you all!",I yearn to be a tiger - but is it possible?,t3_lbywtx,0.0,0.4,xpnyc

I am not particularly hell-bent on getting all As, but I am currently failing two classes and am on the verge of failing another. I am pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADHD/executive function disorder, and I am going currently untreated for GAD. I seem to start assignments and cannot continue studying for more than 10 minutes at a time, after that I begin actively seeking distractions (napping, online browsing, cooking, chores etc). Additionally, I struggle to remember quantitative material, which makes my STEM courses particularly difficult to understand as most derivations are initially too difficult for me to understand. I think I would be able to focus or pass my classes if I maybe had one or two classes with no precepts or labs. 

What i've currently been doing to minimize my burnout has not been working. I stay in regular contact with my DSL, but I do not interact in any with my RCA or PAA as I genuinely do not enjoy my previous interactions with them or my advisory groups. I have been looking for a therapist to for my GAD for the past 8 weeks and I do not have my first appointment with them until after midterms. I am increasing the amount of times I go to office hours, but I notice for some of my classes that I do not have questions for my professors during office hours because they went over the material I am lost on over a week ago. I currently have a McGraw tutor in one of the classes I am not failing, but the limited amount of time does not allow me to learn the material in the way I need to actually retain it. I find it difficult to study regularly throughout the week, either I will spend 7+ hours of pomodoro method studying or I will do nothing all day. 

Has anyone else struggled this much with online learning, and is their anything I can do to  get my grades under control now? This current way of studying is unsustainable, and I am not of privilege to be able to take a gap year or defer in the future.

I know many in CS poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons I'm happy to get into if asked, I'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

0.0,1595316592.0,2.0,princeton,"Hi! I’m an UCI research assistant and I was assigned the task of understanding how major selection works in a few top colleges, one of which includes Princeton. I was wondering if you guys could help me out with a few of your opinions; it definitely doesn’t have to be objective, I’m grateful for all the information, however subjective, I can collect. I've already perused the website and statements by admission officers, but I wanted to hear from actual students, so educated guesses (or even speculation) are all appreciated!

So, here are the questions:

1. Does Princeton require you to input an intended major on your application? Can you put undeclared?
2. If Princeton does require an intended major, after you’re accepted to Princeton with that intended major, does Princeton expect you to follow through? For instance, if a student picked “Computer Science,” will Princeton funnel that student into an engineering department and expect him/her to take engineering courses and activities, or does Princeton really treat everyone the same way no matter what they picked for intended major (at least until they declare)? Is there a limiting of options in regards to classes, activities, etc. for certain majors, even unintentionally?
3. I saw that there was a deadline difference between A.B. and B.S.E degrees, with B.S.E degrees having an earlier declared major deadline. Do you think this affects major selection/major changes (or generally anything about majors) in any way?
4. When does Princeton expect students to declare their majors by? Can a student be truly “Undeclared” up until the point of declaring their majors?
5. And lastly, based on your opinion, does intended major affect admissions? A lot of colleges I’ve looked into have stated publicly that the intended major does not affect admissions, but we also know diversity in ideologies (and thus major) is also important. This, of course, is a very touchy subject and I’m definitely not expecting the absolute, objective truth for this question; just wanted to hear your thoughts.

Other than these questions, if you have any other comments you could share about how students are pressured to take certain majors over others at Princeton, and any reason they would change their major: they would be appreciated!

I am a graduate student from the University of Kansas.

0.0,1589253741.0,69.0,princeton,"Several students have been charged with honor code violations in MAT 202 in the 2020 Spring semester at Princeton University. These charges come at a crucial time during which students are completing Dean’s date assignments and studying for final exams. Under normal circumstances, this would be a very stressful situation, but considering the current state of affairs in the nation, it can be overwhelming for every student in the course.

An anonymous post was made on Tiger Confessions in which a person claiming to be a math PHD student and a TA for MAT 202 stated that the students had been baited by a professor. A quick look into Slader.com led to a contributor account with the user name “Arthur Dent.” This particular account had posted only four solutions. All of the four solutions were for problems from the fifth edition of Linear Algebra with Applications by Otto Bretscher, the exact book used by MAT 202. Of those four solutions, one was in the assigned problems for problem set 9, and two were in the assigned problems from problem set 10. Specifically, 8.1 #23, 8.2 #37, and 8.2 #70. The time at which the solutions were posted was provided in a correspondence email with a content director at Slader after a request was made. The solutions were posted April of 2020. Problem set 9 was due April 27th. Problem set 10 was due the following week. Further inquiry to this account led to the Slader representative indicating that the email associated to the contributor account seemed to be fake. A separate correspondence with Slader stated “Our moderators have confirmed that the answers given by that user were nonsense but written to look like they were reasonable.” The solutions have since been removed, however screenshots were taken and have been linked to this post.

I am a student at Princeton, and I made the poll in the MAT 202 GroupMe chat. Though I knew most students would be hesitant to participate, even a small amount of information would help shed light on what is going on. Currently, the poll stands at 9 students who claim their charges relate to problem #23 from section 8.1, one student claims their charge relates to problem #37 from section 8.2, and zero students have selected “none of the above.” I am not writing this message to accuse any professor of entrapping their students, what I intend to do is bring to light some peculiar information about a situation which has already raised many red flags. Cheating is not right, it reflects poorly on one’s character and negatively impacts peers who put forth an honest effort. But as detrimental as cheating may be, entrapment is just as harmful and just as dishonorable.

# It’s been over six years since Princeton professor Imani Perry  called the police because I criticized her in a blog post. I have still  not been arrested. But she has! Ain’t karma wonderful?

In July 2013, I wrote [this](https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/dr-imani-perry/) blog post where I criticized a section of [this](https://www.thehairpin.com/2013/07/teaching-trayvon/) article, which had been written by [Imani Perry](https://aas.princeton.edu/people/imani-perry), a professor of African-American Studies at Princeton University.

After I wrote that blog post, I wrote the following email to Dr. Perry:

*“I welcome you to show this to your students and anyone else whom you think might like to read it and comment on it.”*

Dr. Perry responded to my email by writing the following email to me:

*“I will be reporting you to the police for harassment.”*

Prior to this, I had thought that Ivy League universities only hired  professors who were interested in having discussions and debates over  topics with which they disagreed. It had never occurred to me that one  of them would call the police simply because someone disagreed with  something that they had said.

Which is why I was totally shocked to find out that Dr. Perry had called the police on me.

Well, it’s been more than six years since Dr. Perry called the police on me, and I still haven’t been arrested.

In the meantime, I recently did some googling to see what Dr. Perry has been up to.

And it turns out that Dr. Perry herself has been arrested!

It actually happened four years ago, but I just found out about it now.

In February 2016, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/us/police-release-video-of-traffic-stop-of-princeton-professor.html):

*The police in Princeton, N.J., released a dashboard video of the traffic stop of a black Princeton professor…*

*The video shows what appears to be a routine traffic stop with the professor, Imani Perry… She was then arrested…*

*After pulling Dr. Perry over, the male officer told her he had clocked her driving at 67 miles per hour in a 45-m.p.h. zone…*

*Fifteen minutes elapsed before the officer returned to her car to tell Dr. Perry that her license had been suspended…*

*About two minutes later, the officer returned to tell her she had a warrant out for her arrest over a parking offense from 2013.*

We claim to attend an elite university, but no university can be truly inspiring, illuminating, and thought-provoking when it invites a riff-raff of normie Class Day speakers.

The previous years we've had actress Ellie Kemper, senator Cory Booker, director Baz Luhrmann, and novelist Jodi Picoult; however, none of these speakers' accomplishments are comparable to the magnificent Snoop Dogg (aka Snoop Lion).

Snoop Dogg is an iconic rapper who has changed the culture of the hip hop throughout his dynamic career. Being nominated for over 17 Grammy's (should've won 17...), selling over 35 million albums worldwide, and making hits like ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" makes Snoop Dogg more than qualified to deliver a brilliant and evocative speech to the Princeton community. Snoop Dogg's experiences are so unique that he even set the Guinness World Record for the largest paradise cocktail. Now that's a man that Princeton needs to learn from.

that's 'the standard story of action' from princeton

- see paper http://www.princeton.edu/~msmith/mypapers/Smith-FourObjections-2012.pdf

**given this, i'd not assume and falsely imagine cultural  ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, or other made up ideas**

- since i dont believe in these made up ideas anymore, i cannot talk in a way that assumes these made up ideas to actually be scientific facts in life, since there is no evidence 

**ppl in many culture &amp; nations live their life without the assumptions of these ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, etc**

- so this indicates that living without these falsely imagined ideas is possible



**we also do not know if everything is causally deterministic, but if everything were, then we would be sure that there's no agency, choice, and freedom etc**

in physics, some things are causally deterministic, and some things arent

- see https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/d2dd4z/open_discussion_according_to_the_best_physicists/

likely more than 50% of all things are not causally deterministic, and that by itself doesnt mean that agency, choice, and freedom exist



**if there were such imagined things as   agency, choice, and freedom, then to what extent is this agency choice &amp; freedom limited or constrained?**

nobody knows but we know it's highly limited &amp; constrained 

- we have no idea if an action is 'intentional' or not, be that our own or actions of others 

- without knowing if something is  intentional, we have no idea if this action is based on our control or not


**not only do we not know the extent, but dont know the minimal requirements of having agency, etc**

&gt; Nonetheless, it falls short of giving us everything we have reason to expect from account of personal autonomy.

&gt; In particular, challenges to different approaches sketched above suggest that they do not spell out the minimal conditions under which person’s exercise of authority over how she behaves reflects her own power to determine how she exercises this authority.

&gt; Minimal self-state seems to require nothing more nor less than being power behind whatever reasoning directly gives rise to one’s behavior.
Yet none of the accounts we have canvassed here seems to capture this important, most basic, form of self-state.

- see https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/#ChalIdenMiniCondPersAuto



**there are external (like gravity) &amp; internal factors (like from neuroscience) that all limit &amp; constrain our options, choices &amp; control over our destiny &amp; our lives**

I will still be taking AP Calc, AP psych along with astronomy, a required communications course, orchestra and a teacher assistant for APUSH. I also already have all of my credits to graduate.

I am only slightly worried since the last sentence of my admissions letter reads, 'we expect that you complete the same classes that you had during the beginning of the year'.

Anyways, Google Maps has really great shots of the exterior of the building, and a wonderful 360 pic of Room 302 itself, but hardly anything of the interior leading up to Room 302. So, basically what I'm looking for is a continuous (unbroken), high-quality vid (iPhone quality, I guess) from the entrance of Frist to 302, and then maybe a second vid from 302 back down to the entrance.

The Princeton Datathon is hosted by Princeton ACM with Citadel LLC &amp; Citadel Securities in partnership with Correlation One. The event will take place on Saturday, September 22nd from 8:00am - 6:00pm at the Princeton University Friend Center.

Highlights include:

* **$25,000 in cash prizes!**

 Certain colleges \(e.g Dartmouth\) are known for being really tight\-kit while others \(e.g Columbia\) supposedly have a weaker sense of campus community. What is the community like at Princeton? Do you know a large percentage of your peers? Do people interact only with small social groups or is there campus\-wide community as well?

I visited Cornell and found it to be sort of massive and impersonal, while I loved Williams and Dartmouth. Where does Princeton fall on this spectrum? I know this is partially an issue of size but I'm particularly curious about the culture.

After careful research, I have concluded that this subreddit's banner color is not consistent with Princeton's color identity. In fact, it occupies some muddled ground in the color space between yellow, orange, gold, honey, tangerine, and carrot (see: [color shade names](https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/color-thesaurus-correct-names-of-shades/)).

According to the [Guide to Princeton University's Graphic Identity](http://trademrk.princeton.edu/secure/uisg/UniversitySG.pdf), ""Princeton Orange"" is defined as PMS 158, a spot color in the [Pantone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantone) Matching System color space. The Guide indicates that the hex equivalent to this color is [#ee7f2d](https://www.colorhexa.com/ee7f2d).

However, the [Office of Communications](https://communications.princeton.edu/guides-tools/logo-brand-assets) notes that PMS 158 is meant for use in print--paper, apparel, and sundries. On the web, Princeton uses [#e77500](https://www.colorhexa.com/e77500) on white backgrounds and [#f58025](https://www.colorhexa.com/f58025) on black backgrounds. Given the current formatting of this subreddit, the former seems to be the most appropriate choice.

Other considerations: The [2007 Princeton Athletics Identity Style Guide](http://trademrk.princeton.edu/secure/protected/AthleticsStyleGuide.pdf) defines ""Athletics Orange"" as PMS 165. However, like PMS 158, this is also meant for use in print. Additionally, ColorHexa refers to [#ff8f00](https://www.colorhexa.com/ff8f00) as Princeton Orange but this is inconsistent with the guidance provided in Princeton's own Guide to Graphic Identity.

0.0,1520623242.0,10.0,princeton,"I've been accepted to the Master's program, and I have several questions about the department to ask before I accept the admission. I've tried reaching out to administrative staff and faculty, but so far all my emails/phonecalls to the department have been ignored. So I'll ask here.

0. **Does the department view Master's students as ""second-hand"" compared to the Ph.D. students?** There seem to be tons of resources for Ph.D. students (and Post-Docs), and I hear only good things about the program, but I've heard nothing about the perspective from a Master's program.

0. **Is research an option for Master's students?** I've been offered funding through a teaching assistantship, but I'm far more interested in research. The website seems to imply that research assistantship is reserved for Ph.D. and Post-Doc students.

0. **How social is the department?** I know this is a very broad and speculative question, but I'm generally interested in what kinds of events or social circles emerge within the department. For example, my current department has a very active social community in the grad program which plans picnics, movie showings, trivia nights, etc.

0. **What kind of resources are available to graduate students?** Another hard to answer question, but it's inspired by my current institution's strong student union. We have a student-run organization that is dedicated to advertising and fighting for TA and RA employment rights. I vaguely recall someone mentioning that the last time people at Princeton tried starting a union, the administration shut it down. I'm just looking for any comments related to this kind of resource.

0. **How is the political climate on/around campus?** I'm coming from a strongly liberal university located near a strongly conservative government institution. I appreciate the diversity of opinions in this area, and I love the many opportunities to be involved in political discussions.

0. **Anything else?** I'm happy to hear any comments about what life as a CS Master's student at Princeton might be like. It's a beautiful and old campus with a huge list of prominent alumni, but I want to know what to expect as an average student.

I'm interested in learning more about graduate life at Princeton University for those who chose to pursue a Ph.D. in Operations Research. 

Regarding pre-requisites, what is the required background you must have? I know this varies from university to university, but some schools, like Columbia, require Real Analysis, a class Engineers usually don't take. If a student lacks knowledge on a particular area, does Princeton give the student some time to catch up? For someone whose undergraduate education was in Engineering, how much ""catching up"" in advanced mathematics is there to be done? 

How many classes are you obligated to take in your first year? What would you say about the workload? 

Research-wise, is there an area that attracts the interest of more professors and students, or a specific area the school is known for? (I'm really interested in the research carried out by the PENSA group).

&gt; encourage applications from students from low-income backgrounds, 
&gt; community college students, and U.S. military veterans. 

As a current freshman at USC (1570 SAT, 4.0 GPA), is it worth applying, or will admission essentially be out-of-reach even for relatively well-qualified applicants?

0.0,1495467067.0,13.0,princeton,"A group of friends and I dined at Salt Creek on Saturday 5/20. I made a reservation for 6 people at 6:00 and 4 of us arrived on time while the other 2 would be arriving a few minutes late. We informed the front desk that we arrived and had a reservation. They looked up my name in the system and confirmed our reservation. They then proceeded to show other guests to tables and left us standing there. We had to go back over to them and ask that we be seated. This was very odd. 

When we got seated we had a wonderful waitress who was very engaging, but who mistakenly advised my whole party that the Sangria along with other ""concoctions"" and mixed drinks were included in the happy hour at the bar that was ending at 6:30. A few of us went up to the bar to order half price sangrias for the six of us. They poured each glass and set them in front of us and then gave us the check where we noticed they were not rung up for half price. We told the bartender and she informed us that they were not included in the happy hour. We explained that we had been explicitly told by our waitress that they were included and if they were not part of the happy hour then we didnt want them. The bartender called over the manager Chad who had earlier left us standing in the lobby waiting to be seated after confirming our party had arrived. He explained again that it wasnt part of the happy hour and that there was nothing he could do so we said we didnt want them. At this point the ""right"" thing to do was to have given us the sangrias at half price because now the poured drinks were just going to go to waste and they might as well get the $6 for them instead of being out the $12 for each glass.

BUT that was not the case because Chad told the bartender to pour the glasses of Sangria back into the large tub of sangria to be served again! Right in front of us the bartender told Chad that you are not allowed to do that but he replied with ""Yes I can"" and proceeded to scoop out the ice from each glass and pour all the sangria back into the serving container to be served again! If this is going on right in front of customers then what is going on behind the scenes at this restaurant!? You CANNOT serve something to a customer and then re-serve it to another! What happened here is the same as bringing a glass of soda to a table and then serving it to another table if the customer never drank from it.

I'm going to be a grad student at Pton in the fall, but I kind of wanted to gauge the culture before going so I knew what to expect. The place I did my undergrad in was located in a college-town where the 70s culture never really left. There are a lot of hippie-dippie leanings and the town is small, inclusive, and definitely focused on the arts/entertainment at large (outside of the university).

I know that Princeton is also a college-town, but I've heard that it's definitely more ""old money"" and Gatsby-esque in some ways. I've never really seen income disparity at my undergrad school, but I've heard that the spectrum is a little more visible at Princeton. Can anyone speak to this?

Also, I'm sure that there is definitely some aspect of fiscal conservatism at Princeton (I grew up a few towns over, I know what it's like), but is Princeton socially-liberal? I'm not expecting the same kind of hippie-freedom that my undergrad school's town had, but it would be comforting to know that Princeton culture isn't too judgmental. I know that art and entertainment play a big role in the culture there, too, but it feels more ""prestige-driven"", as it were, as opposed to art for arts sake? Idk how to explain it. Maybe if y'all came to where I go to undergrad you'd see what I meant, haha.

Anyway, please forgive me if I'm misinformed! I've just heard often that Princeton is in general quite a bit more conservative when compared to other schools in the Ivies (along the lines of Cornell, Brown, etc.), and I was hoping that that wasn't the case.","In your opinion, how conservative is Princeton?",t3_69gm84,6.0,0.81,cartesiancategory

0.0,1492910529.0,6.0,princeton,"Hi,

So I'm going to be a graduate student over at Pton next year, and I was wondering if I could ask a couple of questions about piano lessons on/near campus.

I've been playing continuously since 2005, but I never really cared much to practice until I started college and became more serious about what I did in my free time. Basically, I had formal lessons from 2005 until I left for college a few years ago, but I've been mostly just playing stuff by myself without any guidance for the last couple of years, since I go to school in a pretty remote location in upstate NY and it's hard to find people to teach piano here.

When I come back to civilization next year, I am hoping to actually have someone guide me so I don't develop bad posture/fingerings. Does anybody have recommendations for either teachers or places that I should look for around the Princeton area for a student like me with some experience already? Are teachers around the area usually only kid-focused?

I would like to know a bit more before making my final decision. I plan on visiting the campus in March during my spring break and seeing what it's like.

I was wondering if someone (preferably current or former MSE in CS students) could tell me more about this program. I have some more specific questions below about the thesis-track version of the program:

 * What are the research opportunities like? Is it easy to continue onto a PhD (at Princeton or elsewhere) from the MSE program? I am a pretty weak student coming out of undergrad in terms of research/GPA, so I'd like to use this opportunity to showcase improved academics and a better research portfolio when I apply to PhD programs in 2 years.

 * Are you required to do research between the end of your first year and the beginning of your second year? Or did you do a tech/fintech internship instead?

 * What kind of classes did you have to take? I went to another top-10 school for undergrad, so I think a lot of the classes may be of comparable quality (e.g. we have an equivalent of COS 326 at my undergrad school with some of the same assignments, like Moogle). So I feel like I would want to take classes that I haven't already done in undergrad. Did you get to take anything interesting, or was it mostly focused on your specialization within CS?

 * Can you combine disciplines? I'm interested at the intersection of PL and computer architecture (approximate computing and new hardware/software models to support the new paradigm). Is it easy to find advisors willing to work a little out of their comfort zones to accommodate unusual interests, or are people more traditional?

 * Where did you look for housing? As it happens, I grew up around the area, so I know about the happening areas (I used to frequent Hoagie Haven back in high school). My parents live in Kendall Park (which borders Princeton and is literally off of Route 27, about 10 minutes away).

I have pretty good grades in CIE A-levels. Got A*, A*, B, and A in Physics, Math, Chemistry, and General Paper. As far as standarized tests go, I have taken TOEFL (117/120), and I am taking ACT on October 22. As of now, I get 34-ish score on practice tests, and I am working to bring that up to a 35. On November 5, I am sitting for 3 SAT Subject Tests: Physics, Math 2, and Chemistry. 800s are practically possible on all three. 

Great Recommendation letters. 

Co-curriculuars: Participated in International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2015, but didn't win anything so I don't think it will boost my application. Apart from National Astronomy Olympiads, made the final round of National Physics Olympiad but couldn't make the final team. Again, since I from a small country, olympiads are not all that competitive as in US or China. So I fear colleges will consider these with all seriousness. 

Extra-curriculars: Debated in a bunch of national level debate contests. Won some. Named 'one of the best debaters' in two. In school's debate team and quiz team. Good performances in some national contests. 

Founded and lead a much needed 'public speaking club' in school. 

Other than these, some volunteering activities and some works. Certainly not as impressive as some kids in College Confidential do.

0.0,1462310639.0,3.0,princeton,"Hi guys. Basically I didn't do too well in freshman and sophomore year in high school because of I was quite sick (in and out of the hospital constantly, make-shift clean-room in my room. that kind of fun stuff). Luckily I've gotten better and I'm doing better in school. Currently, I am a senior and for my junior and senior year I have a pretty good GPA (4.9/5) in heavy course load (5 semesters worth of credit in some colleges). I've decided to take a gap year and apply next year so I can show Princeton a bit more of myself. However, what I'm wondering is what direction of work do you think would be better. I'm a lib-arts guy but I enjoy math a lot so I thought maybe I could take some more advanced mathematics courses (multivariable calc or statistics) and some other courses like that. However, I'm also working on a couple of things such as a podcast I do once a week (which surprisingly a single 2 hour episode requires at least 15 hours of research, prep and editing to be decent so it's quite a bit of work). I'm also doing this internship which will be full time once school is over.

What would you recommend I focus on? I mean I can do both but obviously they'll both take a bit of a hit. Personally, I prefer to focus on my projects but I totally understand universities want to see more than 2 years of good academics. Any advice on this matter?

To any student who is still deciding between Princeton and elsewhere, I would like to give you my thoughts about Princeton and the college decision process.

I write this in part because I wish someone had told me these things when I was deciding, and also (admittedly) as a way for me to get my thoughts out of head.

I write this anonymously because I do not want people to remember me as that guy who ranted on the class of 2020 page. But if I could, this is what I would write on that page:


People will rarely tell you what is wrong with their college. You can ask, but they won't give you an honest answer. I know this because , as a prefrosh, I asked tons of current students about things they didn't like about here, and they rarely would give me a straight answer.

I have noticed that when students decide where they are attending, they gain this cult-like affinity for their college, refusing to believe other colleges could have possibly been a better choice. This is somewhat understandable, because people are generally trying to justify to themselves that they made the right choice, but on occasion it creates a fairly negative environment (like the Princeton Class of 20XY pages)

**The students on the class page are not representative of the college** 

The students on the class page are generally the more naive, outgoing people out there.

**Princeton has problems**

Upper classmen dining is socioeconomically stratified. The eating clubs are the rich and upper-middle students, independents are middle income students whose parents are making them pay through college, meal planners are generally the full-financial aid poor kids. As a kid from a poor background, this disgusts me.


**I made the wrong choice coming here**

If all financial aid were equal, I would be Harvey Mudd right now. If I attended there with the aid they offered me I would have had to go into debt, whereas here I got effectively full financial aid. I still wonder if going to HMC would have been worth the debt. Sometimes I wonder if another college that I got equal aid from would have been better as well.

**Students who do not like it here are isolated**

I have a small friend group that is connected simply by the fact that we don't love it here, and I can honestly say we all feel some level of isolation simply because we aren't apart of this group who LOVES it here.

**Yes, this campus is pretty. That doesn't matter as much as you think**

After waking up feeling like burntout shit for the fortieth night in a row, the beauty starts going over your head.


**Social life is homogenous**

If you don't find yourself attracted to either the eating club culture or the VERY specific type of ""alternative culture"" the Alternative (non-drinking) groups bring on campus, you will be hard pressed to find social situations you will strive in. 

People have gotten defensive when I simply *implied* I didn't love it here, as if me not liking it here affected them personally.


**Prestige is (mostly) meaningless**

If you would be successful here, chances are you'd be successful at a state school as well. This is with few concessions (such as jobs in finance). **You will forget what the name ""Princeton"" felt like when you got in. It will be replaced with normalcy**


**Culture is uppermiddle class here**

People act upper middle class, even if they aren't. People feel fake. People aren't directly competitive, but we *all* know we are competing for the same opportunities. However ambiguous this term is: ""fakeness"" is ubiquitous here.


**Fuck your parents**

If your parents are pressuring you to Princeton due to what it will mean for the family name, they aren't being good parents.

**Money does matter**

I feel isolated because I was poor as a kid here. Princeton DOES do a good job of making me feel well off here. They gave me a top-of-the-line laptop, an iPad, and financial aid. *I am eternally grateful for this*. But I still feel isolated. People talk about being ""broke"" because they spent too much going shopping at Sperry's. Someone once said I looked homeless behind my back because my shoes had a hole in them and I was wearing some well-worn jeans. Wealth is pervasive here.

**There is a competitive culture here, it just isn't explicit**


I could go on, but I feel like I am already rambling on. I am certain this is hard to follow but I hope it is helpful to someone.

**To conclude:** Let me be clear here-- a LOT of people do like it here, but they are generally who you are hearing from on the class of 2020 page and whatnot. My point is, the people who do not love it are generally silent because they feel isolated enough as is. I just wish I read something like this when I was deciding, so I hope this helps someone make a better choice for themselves, because it is too late for me.",A letter to deciding students.,t3_4gvm4e,15.0,0.77,JadedClassOf2019

So I have a few things to ask (decisions are like a month away).
So I have 1970 on my sat, a 3.9 (unweighted) GPA, excellent Letters of recommendations. Went to Japanese Camp, done an international project by building an online welfare system for farmers with an Australian university. My short film made it to multiple international film festivals.

Now thanks if you have read so far. If you can answer my question.

Do I stand a chance of getting into Computer science program?

I was invited or contacted, whichever you prefer, for a college interview for Princeton in very early January, with the actual interview having taken place on January 4th. I had submitted my Princeton application on December 13th and was seemingly contacted immediately after the turn of the year on January 2nd. Is this coincidental? I am asking because I saw another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/43e683/international_applicant_invited_for_an_interview/) on this subreddit that was about an international application who had questions regarding the interview about what to expect. One person [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/43e683/international_applicant_invited_for_an_interview/czhqhxo), and I quote:

&gt;The thing is given that you got an interview, it means you are already a **qualified applicant**, and they are looking for qualified applicants that are ""interesting"", ie seem motivated, engaging, and well, actually interested in going to Princeton.

Is that the reason why I was contacted so quickly for an interview?

Had the admissions committee somehow glanced over my application, seen something they liked, making me a qualified applicant, and wanted to interview me ASAP, or was the interview just convenient at that time?

Thanks in advance!

I should have stated in the title that it wasn't just for undergrads to answer because the first thing someone will read is the first statement that mentions undergrads as well as past and hopeful students.",Question for current undergrads regarding interview,t3_45dt26,1.0,0.67,watkinsjoe

Im doing the first year which is common to all science and engineering and still cannot decide wether I should study Mechanical Engineering or Physics. Some background on how degrees work here in Argentina: Physics degree has an estimated duration of 7 years, It has everything Physics and a lot of laboratories. As well as a Thesis on the last year. In the US its probably considered as a bachelors and a little more. The mechanical engineering degree has an estimated duration of six years. Also the last year you have an option of a Thesis. 

Anyways, Im planning on continuing my education. I really like them both and lately I have been thinking of doing ""both"". Like for example Physics here, then study abroad and get a masters in mechanical engineering and a Phd in either mechanical/aerospace engineering or Physics. 

Which degree do you think it will be better? Considering the duration. Also, If I study mechanical engineering firstly I will get a lot of skills which would allow me to live a really good life here in Argentina so if I for some reason change my mind I would have that backup plan. Whereas, with Physics my options are not that wide but the education might be more thorough.

I was looking at some Princeton admission pages and it said that their utmost priority is the ""rigor of Secondary school record"". The internet has conflicting info on this. Does this mean how much you challenged yourself and how many of the hardest courses you took, or does this mean how difficult your high school is? If applicant A comes from fancy private school with about normal to fairly rigorous record, and applicant B comes from normal public high school, and took the most challenging courses (Which may or may not be more than student A due to the courses offered at their school), who would get admitted? I am essentially trying to figure out if I am at a disadvantage by going to a local public high school that is near by.

[HiTOPS](http://www.hitops.org), New Jersey's only health education center exclusively for adolescents and young adults, is producing this event to promote physical fitness and healthy living, while raising awareness about how healthier decisions made during adolescence can improve community health.

As a special treat to the Princeton subreddit, **we are offering $5 discounts to TEN RUNNERS using promo code reddit**. This course covers 13.1 miles of Princeton, starting off by the library on Paul Robeson Place, and then traveling out to the Princeton Battlefield, through the Institute Woods, through some neighborhoods before **crossing the Princeton campus by traveling along Faculty Road and up Washington Road**. From there, the course goes around Westminster Choir College, out to the Herrontown Woods, and back into downtown.

If you have any questions about the race, let us know! This is the first year that the race does not fall over the break, so we hope to have as many students, faculty, and staff from PU as possible!

1) As a prospective premed student, the majors seem a little limited compared to Cornell, for example EEB or Molecular Bio. Will this affect me in any significant way?

2) The idea of a thesis seems intimidating yet cool at the same time. How helpful were the faculty in helping write the thesis and overall how difficult is it?

3) A lot of people are telling me to not come here because it is ""preppy."" Understanding that this is mostly a myth, how easy is it for your average middle-class student to fit in?

4) This question is about the grading system: How does it work exactly? And does the attempt to curb inflation help or hinder students?

5) How are the opportunities for extracurriculars like research or volunteering on and off campus? Given the relative proximity to NYC compared to Cornell, how feasible is it to do something in NYC on weekends perhaps?

6) What are your opinions on the dorming system?

I am visiting on Sunday to get more of a feel of the campus and environment there, which will surely help me decide. Thanks guys, I would really appreciate your opinions.",Some questions from a prospective freshman undergraduate - would appreciate answers soon.,t3_365y61,8.0,1.0,Porky799

I hope you're all well and staying healthy.

I am currently beginning my search for graduate programs to apply to and I discovered from a very simple Google search that Yale University is ranked as one of the best schools for graduate art programs. For current students and alumni, how accurate is this?

For context, I am an Asian immigrant, a woman, DACA recipient, have a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Texas at Austin (Matthew McConaughey frequents the journalism buildings and I once rode the elevator with him), and currently working as Assistant Editor at a local book publishing company in Austin, Texas. I also have bylines published in *Texas Monthly*. From my research online, I think the best option for me would be the Terminal Master's Degree Program in English and Literature because I'm not looking to pursue a PhD and quite frankly cannot afford the tuition.

I guess I am just wondering whether the Terminal Degree Program at Yale is worth pursuing and how it compares to other ranked universities. In addition, since Yale has an incredibly slim acceptance rate, what can an applicant do to stand out?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

I was doing some casual research into possible opportunities in the summer of ‘22 (again not looking seriously into it, just looking ahead). Several that stood out to me were unpaid. 

To my understanding, undergrads can fund underpaid experiences domestically with the domestic summer award, and with grants/fellowships. However, as a student on financial aid, I am forced to make money over the summers (3200 or so I believe). Is it impossible for me to take on full-time unpaid opportunities as a result? I have to make money somehow, and I wouldn’t be making any by simply using grant money to do unpaid work. 

Am I missing something? I’m also confused how I would afford the study abroad programs with the ISA if I am still required to make money over the summer (would I have to be employed part-time during it?).

* STEM majors, how has it been learning at a school that's known for focusing on humanities?
* How has your experience in the New Haven area been?
* Is there a ""superiority"" complex among students with regards to Harvard? That's the vibe I've gotten from admitted students chats so far.

Hey everyone! I was accepted to Yale REA and think I'll commit soon. It's my dream school and I can't see myself anywhere else. But, I wanted to see if anyone on this sub could help inform me before I make a final decision.

Firstly, I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to major in, but I know it will be in either chemistry or biology. As of now, I'm probably doing Molecular Biophysics &amp; Biochemistry. But, I have no clue what I want to do as a career, and wouldn't be surprised if I decided to switch to an Econ or Data Science/Stats major. The thing I liked about Yale was the ability to easily switch majors, I know some schools are tough since you have to transfer between colleges, but that's not the case at Yale.

Yale is also a very humanities-heavy school, but from what I've read, it's been pouring A LOT into improving its STEM programs. I don't see this as a large issue, since I enjoy humanities as much as STEM, just can't see myself majoring in anything non-STEM. The reason I didn't apply to a school like MIT is b/c I value the importance of a liberal arts education that Yale provides. Yale seems like a great school for general science (biology, physics, chem, etc. which I hope to do). It also seems like there are endless opportunities for research which interest me as well. Could anyone that's majoring in STEM talk about their experiences?

Finally, more general stuff. How's New Haven? Do you find yourself stuck in a ""Yale bubble"" or do you get the chance to explore? Do you connect with students from surrounding colleges at all?

The financial aid was great, so that’s not a concern. My family wants me to commit as well.

The “problem” (extremely good problem to have, I almost feel bad even worrying about an acceptance to YALE) is that I’m a STEM student. I don’t really know what I wanna do with my life, but I’ve gone to a STEM high school and that is more than likely what I’ll end up majoring in. I do have interests outside of math/science, and loved the idea of getting to know a variety of people in Yale residential colleges and having a liberal arts education. However, everything I’ve read says Yale isn’t that strong in STEM. 

I know at this caliber (for undergrad especially?) the distinctions of the relative strengths of the fields aren’t THAT relevant, but I keep feeling like I might be ill advised not trying for Stanford and Princeton (as a potential engineering student) even though I like Yale more... do any STEM students at Yale have something to say about the strength of stem, why you chose Yale as a stem student, etc?

I was accepted tonight as a transfer to Yale!! I am very excited as when I applied the first time it was my first choice.

I spent the past year on a leave of absence from my college pursuing my professional acting and recorded music careers, which have both made me happier than I've ever been. I decided to transfer from my previous institution because there was no artistic community / available courses in acting/playwriting/recorded music, and it was too far away from LA auditions (2-2.5 hours 1 way). I was also accepted to Columbia University (a school that I have more friends at and am way more acquainted with) and am now tasked with the difficult decision between the two. If I was at Yale, would I feasibly be able to continue auditioning in NYC with my agency and not have to put my career on pause for 3 years? At Yale, would I get stronger connections/ inroads to the industry than at Columbia? Stronger training? Additionally, I've heard nothing about people at Yale pursuing a career in recorded (pop) music. Is there a community of non-classical musicians/producers on campus?  Any advice is appreciated!!

There is a good chance that there won't be in-person classes in the fall. Nobody knows for sure, but it's pretty likely at this point and departments are preparing for it. Don't waste your tuition money on really overpriced webinars from Yale. Wait a year to come, and then get four full years of Yale. In addition, then you have a better chance of graduating into an economy that is one additional year away from this mess, which will probably better for your job prospects when you graduate.

0.0,1587748235.0,19.0,yale,"Edit: thanks for all the advice, I decided to commit to Stanford

Hi everyone! I was extremely lucky to be admitted to both of these great schools. I've been agonizing over this decision for the last month and still haven't come to a final decision. There are things I love and dislike about both schools, and I think I would be happy at either. I'll try my best to outline what I see to be the advantages and disadvantages of Stanford vs. Yale in Academics, Student Experience, and Career Outcomes as they relate to my interests and goals- please correct me if you disagree with any of my assessments and lmk if you have relevant info/experiences!

**Academics:** *I am interested in Analytic Philosophy and CS/logic. Right now, I think I want to study both of these fields in college, but I am very open to exploring new areas.*

* Obviously, the overall quality of education is pretty much the same at both of these schools.
* Stanford’s strengths and resources are tilted towards STEM, while Yale’s are tilted towards the humanities. The majors I’m interested in at each school are Symbolic Systems at Stanford and Math + Philosophy at Yale. Both of these programs seem like they leverage their school’s institutional strengths well.
* At Stanford, it looks like it’s much easier to get a master’s degree with your bachelor’s in 4 years, which is something I would like to do. (thinking of Symsys BS with CS coterm)
* At Yale, it seems easier to double major than at Stanford, which isn’t too important to me, but I would want to do this if I can’t get a master’s degree.
* Both schools have grade inflation, but it looks like inflation is more prevalent at Yale.

**Student Experience/Culture:** *I grew up in the south and attended high school at an elite prep school in the northeast. I'm looking for a new, exciting college experience that pushes me to challenge myself and grow*

* Stanford has better weather and a more exciting location in SV. A lot more appealing to me than crime-ridden, cold, economically depressed New Haven
* Yale might have a friendlier, more open social scene due to residential colleges, as opposed to Stanford, which I’ve heard is cliquey.
* It seems like Stanford is less elitist/stuffy, which I see as a refreshing departure from my high school experience.
* I feel like I might fit in better socially at Stanford as an Asian dude who's not from an elite family.
* My impression is that Stanford's culture is more pre-professional than Yale's, which I appreciate.
* I don't like how Stanford seems very STEM-dominated, especially as someone whose primary interest lies outside of the natural sciences. Yale seems to have more diversity of academic interests, which I like.

**Career Outcomes:** *I’m not sure what I want to do as a career, but I’ll probably either go into Consulting/Tech/Finance or off to Law School (like most people at these schools lmao)*

* Name Brand- virtually the same overall (will open most of the same doors), but my impression is Stanford fares better on the west coast and internationally, while Yale’s brand is stronger on the east coast.
* It seems to me that Stanford, being a younger school, doesn’t have the same deep roots that Yale does in fields dominated by old money / HYP, such as Wall Street and Politics
* Yale’s network is stronger in Wall Street, Government, and Law, while Stanford’s network is stronger in High Tech, VC, and Business.
* Yale’s alumni are largely concentrated in NYC, and Stanford’s alumni are mostly in the Bay Area. I can see myself working in either area.

Overall, I think Stanford and Yale will serve me equally well academically and in my future career. Based on the school cultures/expected student experience, I'm leaning towards Stanford right now b/c of its better location, more down-to-earth students, and the exciting prospect of moving away from what I'm used to in the northeast.

I'm sure I made many incorrect statements and am missing many other dimensions to consider- please correct me and share your relevant info/experiences!",Please help a conflicted prospective student to decide: Yale vs. Stanford,t3_g7c8iv,19.0,0.88,invertedfractal

Today I got an email from the Eli Whitney Program team about setting up an interview in a few weeks (Zoom, of course). I was just seeing if you guys have any advice as well as answers to a few questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

First off, how much stock should I even be putting into the fact I got an interview in the first place? I want to be excited because, from what I've seen, they handpick people for it but I can't find a good source to confirm that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, what would the 'tone' of the interview be? I did one with Harvard a few days ago and it was a really friendly interview with a pretty wide range of questions (personal life, background, academic/non-academic interests, future plans, why 'X' school, etc.). Is it safe to say it will be pretty similar? 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, in my spare time, I read a LOT of works that have to do with the topic I'm hoping to major in (Global Affairs) and I try to stick to respected scholars and publications. I'm honestly just a massive nerd for the subject and I enjoy reading about it constantly. Assuming that it's something relevant to the questions being asked, would it seem too 'try-hard' to bring this up? I really am the type of person who uses their free time to read books by academics, but I don't want to talk about it if it makes me come across as inauthentic or that I believe that I know it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, what are just some general pitfalls people often fall into or things they tend to omit that they should have emphasized more? Or really, just any advice in general, unironically I don't know shit so I'll take any wisdom that comes my way.

I graduated high school last year and deferred my admission to Yale (and my pre-admission to DS). My gap year has been eye opening but I fear that my writing skills have atrophied.

I went to a private school and learned to churn out analytical papers. The last time I wrote an argumentative paper, however, was 10 months ago. If I were quoting today I'd probably need Google to get the formatting right. I'm worried that, compared to my peers fresh out of school, I'll be starting behind. 

I'm back home now and have to sharpen up. 

Do you have any specific tips for tackling DS papers or resources for college writing in general? What about advice for how to practice academic writing on my own.

Sorry for the influx of admit questions haha, but I was wondering if anybody would be willing to answer a few questions I have. 

\- How are the opportuneness for global health and health policy at Yale for undergrads?

\- are Yale students generally very stressed out?

\- how are the ethnicity race and migration/sociology/history of science medicine and public health majors?

\- it might be my imposter syndrome kicking in haha but is it possible to have a high gpa at a place like Yale? I'm looking to go into law school for health policy, so keeping a high gpa is important for me. 

\- is it hard to get pre-law opportunities/internships as an undergrad?

I was a recent admit for the class of 2024, and was just wondering if anyone could provide some quick insight on chemistry programs/majors at Yale.

Would you recommend bio or some other science for pre-med because of Yale's chem rep? Trying to sort out some options.

Dear YSM Faculty:

In follow-up to recent communications from President Salovey, Provost Strobel, and me, basic science chairs and directors convened today to discuss the meaning of critical or essential work in the laboratory setting. As the situation on-the-ground around COVID evolves, so must our definition of critical and essential functions in the laboratory.

As always, the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and patients are our priority.

At this time, examples of critical laboratory work include research on the causes and mechanisms of viral (COVID-19) infection; therapeutic clinical research studies; monitoring of the safety and efficacy of patients in ongoing clinical trials; testing of patient/research samples for ongoing clinical trials that cannot be paused; and other lab work that impacts the immediate safety and health of our patients and community. Preservation of precious resources such as cell lines or animals so as to avoid the disruption of months or years of work may also be viewed as critical, in which case specific team members should be identified to maintain these resources and complete critical experiments.

Investigators or lab members should not come to work if they are having symptoms, and all should practice social distancing. It is important to note that investigators can be very productive while working from home. Some have expressed concerns about the impact of decreased productivity on their life’s work and career development; please know that the university and YSM will be developing a policy to extend the tenure clock commensurate with the duration of interruptions.

More detailed information regarding human subjects research can be viewed here.

\-  When spring recess ends and through April 5 at the earliest, classes will be held using Zoom, Canvas, or other online tools. I know classes take many forms across the university, so this shift to online teaching and learning raises many questions. Deans will be communicating with their faculty and students to provide further details in the days ahead. 

\-  We are asking Yale College students to remain at home after spring recess. For undergraduates who are on campus now, please make every effort to return home as soon as possible, and no later than Sunday, March 15. Yale College Dean Marvin Chun will be providing additional details in the coming days. Undergraduates will have the support of the university in meeting their academic requirements remotely while at home. I understand that some undergraduates consider New Haven to be their home or cannot leave the university at this time. The Yale College Dean’s Office will provide separate instructions for these students, who also will take their classes online.

Graduate and professional students are encouraged to remain off-campus and participate in online instruction, unless required to be on campus due to the nature of their research or academic programs. More information is forthcoming from the deans of each school.

I am considering the Computer Science PhD program at Yale. Could someone help me with few questions about funding at Yale?

Source of funding:

* Does the program funds for all \~5 years or the adviser funds (after finding one)?
* What fraction of PhD students TA? I have seen that students in less glamorous fields like Theory tend to TA.

Stipend:

* How much is the total PhD stipend for a regular student before all deductions?
   * During the regular Fall and Spring semester.
   * During the Summer semester.
* Are there any out of pocket mandatory fees - say for the shuttles, gym, etc?

Could not find this info [here](http://www.phdstipends.com/results).

Housing and others:

* For how many years does Yale provide subsidized graduate housing?
* Does Yale provide vision and dental for free or subsidized?

0.0,1571410597.0,6.0,yale," For the [**sixth semester in a row**](https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/Yale-says-sexual-misconduct-complaints-increase-14456597.php), sexual misconduct reports have gone up at Yale University, [**double the number**](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/) from spring 2017.

And the Yale official responsible for compiling the report seems to regard these rising numbers as a positive development.

“We are hopeful that the increase in complaints reported to the University is an indication that our community is more aware of and more frequently accessing our resources,” Stephanie Spangler, Title IX coordinator and deputy provost for health affairs and academic integrity, told the [***Yale Daily News***](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/)*.*

Some of those analyzing the [**recent semi-annual report**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Sexual%20Misconduct%20Report%20Jan-Jun%202019.pdf) are skeptical of the high numbers, however, largely due to the broad definitions for terms such as sexual harassment and sexual assault.

With 169 claims filed from January through June alone, the Ivy League school would have a “much higher violent crime rate than any of the nation’s most dangerous cities” if the report is to be believed, Brooklyn College Prof. KC Johnson, who chronicles Title IX enforcement at colleges nationwide, wrote in a recent analysis.

The broad definitions have real consequences for students’ rights, according to Samantha Harris, vice president for procedural advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

“By giving the impression that the university is a hotbed of violent sexual crimes,” she told*The College Fix* in an email, “a broad definition like this fosters the type of climate of fear that has led to the wholesale abandonment of due process in campus sexual misconduct adjudications. It also trivializes real sex crimes.”

Yale did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls from *The Fix* Oct. 8-14, asking for its response to Johnson’s analysis of the report, published in [***Minding the Campus***](https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2019/10/04/is-yale-more-dangerous-than-detroit/).

***‘Counseling’ is the common response to sexual misconduct***

Johnson is a [**recurring critic**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/yales-latest-report-on-its-sexual-misconduct-investigations-shows-more-curiosities/) of the so-called Spangler reports. He noted that despite the huge number of reported cases, “only five sexual assault cases were adjudicated” during the most recent six-month period.

Four of the five accused students were found guilty, yet the punishments – including short suspensions or probation – “suggest the actual offense was far less severe than the commonly understood definition of sexual assault,” he wrote.

Johnson also pointed out that Spangler has “removed more and more details from her reports” over the years, including details of “third-party reports involving anonymous alleged victims and accused students.”

The report, released in mid-September, is the 16th since 2012. It covers sexual misconduct reports to Yale Title IX coordinators, the Yale Police Department, and the [**University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct**](https://provost.yale.edu/uwc/procedures) for the first six months of the calendar year.

The half-year report, like its predecessors, “illustrates the danger of lumping everything from groping to forcible rape under the umbrella term ‘sexual assault,’” said Harris, whose work with FIRE concerns issues of free speech and due process on campus.

“If one reads the report, one sees that the university commonly responds to reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault simply by ‘counsel\[ing\] the respondent on appropriate conduct’ — including in response to reports of penetration without consent!” she told *The Fix*, highlighting pages 10 and 11 of the report:

&gt;If counseling respondents is truly the university’s response to rape, that is grossly inadequate — but what I suspect this actually reflects is the university’s use of an ambiguous and confusing “affirmative consent” definition, under which sex is not consensual unless there is “positive, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement to engage in specific sexual activity throughout a sexual encounter,” which must be re-affirmed for each new sexual act and which can be “revoked at any time.”

Harris argues that definitions such as these are “likely to engender a great deal of confusion among participants in sexual encounters.”

After New York approved an [**affirmative consent law**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/law-professors-line-up-against-new-yorks-new-campus-sexual-assault-law/) that applies only to colleges, FIRE [**interviewed local students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/) about it, Harris noted, learning that “they found the definition highly confusing and were uncertain about what was now prohibited.

“In light of these broad definitions, it is perhaps not surprising that Yale has been the subject of at least 6 lawsuits brought by students accused of sexual misconduct,” she said, “alleging they were denied a fair process in their on-campus judicial proceedings.”

**MORE**: [**New York affirmative consent law baffles students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/)

***Yale more dangerous for female grad students than for undergrads?***

Further analysis of the report shows that 146 of the misconduct claims went to the Title IX office, which handles informal resolution, while only seven went to the university-wide committee, which actually adjudicates complaints.

The average age of reporting students has risen, both at Yale and nationally, according to Johnson. He attributes this trend to older students having attended college in an “accuser-friendly Title IX environment.”

If valid, this trend would indicate that Yale “becomes more dangerous for female students as they age out of the 18-24-year-old cohort.”

In the Yale cohort of the Association of American Universities’ 2015 “[**climate survey**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/WestatReportYaleUniversity-1.pdf)” on sexual assault and misconduct, 16.1 percent of Yale students reported they had experienced an attempted or completed act of sexual misconduct. Spangler is one of the credited designers of this [**national survey**](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/%40%20Files/Climate%20Survey/AAU_Campus_Climate_Survey_12_14_15.pdf), which will release 2019 results later this year.

Yale might not be alone in the Ivy League when it comes to a spike in reported sexual misconduct.

Last week Harvard University announced the debut of an anonymous Title IX reporting form, following apparent interest from the student body. It will allow students to submit Title IX complaints against anyone at Harvard with no trace back to themselves.

[***The Harvard Crimson***](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/8/title-ix-anonymous/#.XZycnWshBfU.twitter) notes that the rollout “follows the Government Department Committee on Climate Change’s recommendation that Harvard institute an anonymous reporting system in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez.”

Asked if he saw a connection between the new Harvard reporting system and the high number of complaints at Yale, Johnson told *The Fix* in an email that the two situations weren’t connected but rather “problematic for their own reasons.”

“Harvard raises issues \[because\] it allows anonymous complaints by witnesses \[with an\] explicit statement that the \[accused\] party won’t learn of the allegation,” he said. In an aside, Johnson said Harvard’s system “is already less fair than Yale’s, which is saying something.”

The core problem with Yale’s system is the “extremely broad definition of sexual assault” combined with Spangler’s practice of “leaving readers with the implication that all of these allegations have been adjudicated and upheld, even though only a tiny percentage of them are,” he said.

i’m a first year still figuring out my course schedule and i have narrowed it down to a few options. 

Thus far, I have only really decided on the following three courses:

Calc 115 ( calc 2) 
Chem 174 ( First year orgo) 
Chem 222La ( lab for organic chem) 
The History of World History ( First year seminar)

I am having difficulty choosing my fourth course. i want something that is easy considering how hard the rest of my schedule is. 

My current contenders are the following: 

Fren130 ( L30 french with Ruth Koizim) 
Econ 110 ( seminar of intro to microeconomics) 
Econ 115 ( into to microeconomics) 
Bio 101 ( intro to bio) 

i don’t want to take french this semester because of how hard the professor makes the course sound; in addition to meeting everyday, Koizim proudly declared that she would be assigning 90-120 minutes of homework every night, which i feel would be too much considering my other classes. 

I have heard that it is better to take Bio during the off cycle. 

Anyway, i would love to hear your thoughts on what my fourth course should be. i want to have a schedule that would keep me busy but also allow me time to have a social life and delve into extracurricular activities. And because i am currently considering attending medical school, it is necessary that i do well in my classes.

While I am attracted to the proximity with some of Yale’s best professors, the seminar learning environment, and the close knit community that DS platforms, I just don’t feel very interested by the summer reading and have been bored to death by the Iliad. My academic interests, as of now, lean more towards the history and literature of MENA and south east asia and the legacy of colonialism. That is not to say that i plan on avoiding the classics through my undergraduate career though.  I also feel hesitant to dive into what seems to be a rigorous program during my first year at Yale when I would rather be gathering my bearings and investing time into my social life.

I worry, however, that by not doing DS i wouldn’t be availing the best of what yale has to offer and that i would miss out on a community of DS students that’d make for some wonderful friends. Also, it seems that ex DSers are particularly well represented in programs such as the Brady-Johnson grand strategy program and selective majors, so i worry that if i decide not to DS i will be at a disadvantage and a weaker student in the eyes of my professors. 

tl; dr: will i have a harder time making friends if i’m not in DS and will i regret it later on in my undergraduate career?

Yale does have a great arts program, but it's mostly for graduate school. I talked with an art undergrad student and she said Yale is not great for undergrad art studies.

I never ate alone, even in dining halls where I didn’t know anyone. Some Yalies would always take pity on me and invite me to sit with them. 

My hosts were amazing, but I found plenty of wonderful Yalies while sitting in common rooms or in classrooms or on park benches as well. Students would recognize the BDD bracelet on my wrist and introduce themselves to me and offer to talk to me about my major or show me around. 

Even more than being kind, every Yalie I met was thoughtful and non-judgmental, even when I was nervous and stuttering through the day. Not every conversation was about quantum physics or objective morality, but I walked away from every conversation having learned something new. Even better, I felt like the Yalies I talked to wanted to listen and learn from me too.

I heard FOOT is the most popular and that it fosters very intimate and long term bonds, which I love. It also sounds super fun. The bad thing is that it costs a bit and I won't get financial aid to cover it, and beyond the upfront $460 i would also need to purchase most of the equipment on the packing list (even though they say to just borrow things, no one I know is a big fan of hiking, so I can't).

I am willing to foot (no pun intended) the cost of FOOT if it is truly worth it over the other programs. 

On the other hand, it seems like Harvest is less popular. I've heard less about it and I don't even know the costs associated, but I love taking care of animals/animal husbandry and I'd love to experience farm life. I don't know if it fosters the same intimate connection that FOOT does though.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, this reads as an under-handed journalistic work. The   
report overly represents people who deem the Executive order to be   
""over-reaching."" Only one student is presented as a supporter of the   
Executive order. It also seems that there's a delusion on this campus   
that freedom of speech should be concerned about not making students   
uncomfortable. This is preposterous! Yale is supposed to be a space of   
intellectualism, where you face challenges from people with opposing   
views (yes, those views can make you uncomfortable), and draw your own. I  
 am very curious to find out how many students support the Executive   
order. If the YDN is curious too, it should send out a survey!

For activities, I am currently in a small orchestra at Brown and I am starting to run a magazine by myself. (I am also participating in a Christan fellowship group. However, this does not count anything.)

I applied to Yale as a freshman last year but got rejected. I was admitted by Tufts University and RISD and some other art schools.

My conductor went to Yale as well and went to the same high school as me. However, he is a LEGENDARY cellist, and had already knew Yale people. My school is not known for academics, as we have no AP courses, no honor courses, and is located in Vancouver Canada. I think my conductor is the only guy in my school that went straight to an IVY. He graduated in the 90's but the competition would still be tough back then. Pretty much everyone I've seen get in has accomplished something HUGE, or is super prestigious by their junior year in something. 

I know the cliche would be ""be yourself"", but from doing ""intensive"" research, the ""be yourself"" for many people who got in is pretty much all the things I described above. I self learned AP Calc and Phys in my sophomore year as I wanted to continue math but my school didn't offer it, I started a chamber band club which is turning into a official government approved class next year that counts for grades, I started a robotics class at my elementary school, I do orchestra and piano, volunteer at a elementary band, I am currently taking second  year math courses at a university, (currently in my junior year), and I am working on a math paper and do musical compositions as well. 

I am doing all that I love and striving to follow my dream which is to give back to the community as best as I can in every step of my life, and I know that many people say ""thats what matters"", but so far, everyone I see get in, has ""Eagle scout for 6 years"", or ""self-learned 20 APs with all 5s"", ""grew up in a poor abusive household and managed to win and lead international math olympiad"", ""working at local hospital"", or ""won 3 world-wide science fairs in a row"" or something on those lines.

My application is a lot better now and has been amended to better represent me as an applicant, but I’m worried that last year will hold me back.

0.0,1541413398.0,13.0,yale,"I'm an international student in South Korea (no US citizenship). I'm currently a junior.

I want to ask about the atmosphere at Yale since it is near impossible for me to actually visit American colleges regularly. This is going to be somewhat long, so bear with me, please!

I'm not sure what I want to major in yet, but currently, I have an interest in medicine and want to become a doctor (pathologist) someday. My counselor is recommending biology. However, I also love writing, doing research and studying non-science subjects, such as comparative politics and literature as well. I genuinely enjoy every subject I take except for Korean history. Students like me have trouble studying in the Korean curriculum because, starting from sophomore year, Korean students are forced to pick either a science curriculum or a non-science curriculum. This is the main reason why I wanted to study abroad.

I got the idea that even though Yale offers great science courses like MCDB, it emphasizes the arts and humanities. I yearn to take courses in literature, writing, and perhaps politics as well when I'm in college. Schools like MIT, Caltech, or Princeton, even though they are absolutely amazing (no doubt), doesn't really seem right for me because they are more science-orientated. Also, I'm tired of competing with everyone I study with. The Korean education system is extremely competitive, and kids fail to go into the college of their choice because they make a mistake or get one more question wrong in their school tests. This causes enmity and exasperation for everyone. I don't mind a little competition, but I want to study in an environment where people are willing to help each other and are less competitive or greedy.

First of all, is the atmosphere I'm picturing above accurate? If not, which schools in the US fit this picture? This is really important in making my college choice.

Second, does Yale care less for the science students compared to the humanities?

Third, Does Yale offer a lot of research opportunities for science majoring undergrads? I'm asking this because lots of US unis tend to focus more on graduate students.

Last, a lot of people say my ethnicity give me an advantage because lots of Asians have good stats. I have no idea if this is true. Based on your experience, what is an acceptable stat for an Asian female Yalie?

Only two people have gotten in Yale in our school so far, and it is depressing every time someone says nobody can go in because we're Asian. My current stats are sat 1540 (math 800, lang 740), Math 2 800, and three 5s for APs (comparative politics, psychology, micro). Straight As so far, and I am the top of my year. I took bio last weekend, and hopefully, it will be an okay score. I'm retaking SAT I this december. My stats are low because I starting considering studying abroad, and moved to an international school this February. Are my stats THAT BAD?

We do, however, plan to host more AMAs in the future! Follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, or sign up on our email list, to be notified of when our next AMA will take place.* 

MindMap is a New Haven based public education campaign hosted by the Program for Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP). We provide free, local and effective treatment for people who may be experiencing psychosis, as well as support for their families. We are a collaborative program of the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services and the Yale University Department of Psychiatry.

Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. Symptoms can include hallucinations, delusions, increased distractibility and withdrawal.

The goal of our campaign is early intervention. We want to spread awareness about the early warning signs of psychosis, so that people can receive help as soon as possible. First symptoms of psychosis most commonly appear between the ages of 18 and 24, the majority of fist episodes occurring between 13 and 30 years of age.

With this new semester starting, we wanted to give the Yale &amp; New Haven communities the opportunity to ask any questions that they may have about mental health, psychosis, symptoms or treatment. Please leave your questions here and I will be back to answer them. I look forward to chatting with many of you!

Thing is, I imagine the undergrads are all exposed to new club/fraternity/social opportunities across the university, but the Grads definitely aren't. There are some specific clubs I'd be really interested in joining, and I'm not sure how I can go about getting on that before it's too late.

I'm an international from the UK who has just moved into Yale. 

I wanted to ask some questions to the community, so thought I would pool them concisely into one post - I hope that's OK! It's a bit of a leap starting up in a new country so these questions might sound dumb, but I just want to make sure I get things right.


1) Is there a good place to buy a bicycle? Ideally a decent second hand bike would be fine. But I'm not sure where to look, particularly for second hands. 

2) Which provider has best phone signal in Yale? I'll mainly be using data for everything (if not Wifi), and I'll mainly be in New Haven, NYC, or Boston for the next few years. So I'm looking for consistent good phone data, and not too pricey. 

3) What bank could people recommend to set up a simple checking account, just to move money in, use it to pay with a card (debit), take cash out, and occasionally receive money? I've seen Bank of America's everywhere - are they user friendly for a simple checking account?


Thanks for all the advice, and sorry if it's all a bit obvious - everything is strange and new for me and your advice is much appreciated.

I've also heard that the placement test is extremely difficult. I reread the Barron's AP Bio book, but apparently much of the placement test material goes beyond the scope of the AP curriculum. How should I go about studying? Thanks!

EDIT Post-Exam: This may have been the most ridiculous exam I've ever taken. The test questions are completely unrelated to the topics the module ostensibly covers. Which isn't to say the questions, if you can even call them that, are difficult conceptually. The content is standard, but the questions just cryptic and meaningless. Often they just make a vague assertion and the impetus is on you justify it. But there's a 2 sentence limit (yes, that's a thing--as if longer, ie. 3 or more sentence, answers are wrong), so you better hope that you read the grader's mind and those 2 sentences were *exactly* what they were looking for because you only get one shot. This whole test is basically an exercise in just Googling random specific things (not necessarily even related to the course material) quickly such that you have enough time to summarize the answer stated explicitly on some random Wikipedia article from 12 sentences into 2 to adhere to the sentence limit and sufficiently obfuscate the content to avoid plagiarism. 30 minutes to do 11 unrelated, arbitrary Google Search summaries, no biology expertise evaluated whatsoever.

I'm a prefrosh deciding whether to enroll in Math 120 or 230 in the fall, and also physics 200 or 260.

My background in math is quite good, and I'm comfortable with proofs. However, I've had limited exposure to multivariable calc as a whole.

As for physics, I'm very well versed in theory, and physics proofs/theory are what interest me the most about the subject. Yet, I'm slightly lacking in my ability to solve physics problems because I've only ever self-studied physics.

Any thoughts are appreciated.

I got into a Ph.D. program at MIT a few days ago, and it's one of my top choices. I kind of want to get a feel for grad student life at MIT before I accept, but can't visit for obvious reasons. If I accept the offer, I suspect I'll have to pick an apartment/neighborhood basically sight-unseen. I have a couple questions, and it would be great to hear what y'all think.

In my current college town, there are, like, grad student residential areas and undergrad-y residential areas, differentiated mostly by noise level and (social) fraternity/sorority population. I suspect the latter's not an issue at MIT, but are there quieter neighborhoods close to campus? Or are all neighborhoods roughly the same? 

Related question: is grad student housing any good? Or should I look for an apartment? I sort of assumed grad student housing wouldn't be great since it isn't at a lot of the other places I applied, but maybe I'm wrong. My financial situation is ok: I don't have tons to spend, but my stipend offer is really generous. I *hated* living in the dorms my freshman year of college, though, because I like lots of privacy and quiet. But maybe that's not a problem in grad student housing at MIT. (I just don't want a roommate.)

* Weather is bad but CSAIL students never leave their lab anyways.
* People tend to work on things that never end up being adopted by the ""outside world"" and are only used, almost incestuously, inside MIT.
* Profs discourage internships, industry affiliation, and other outside world contact.
* Work-life balance is more poor than, say, SAIL and BAIR.
* Overall, MIT is a castle with little contact with the outside world where PhD students slowly decay inside (like Azkaban).

I can’t believe this is literally three months after they settled the class action lawsuit about not providing good 401(k) options. What, was that a slap on the wrist? I’ve only looked up one of the fun so far but it’s the index fund and it has .31% fees versus the .02% that the Vanguard fund it is replacing has. Can we *do* something?

Dear MIT 401(k) Plan Participant,

On behalf of MIT, the MIT Supplemental 401(k) Oversight Committee (“Committee”) regularly monitors and reviews the investment options offered in the 401(k) Plan. Recently, the Committee, with the guidance of its investment consultant, has decided to replace nine funds in the Plan with similar plans from the same asset classes. This fund change will occur during the evening of February 22, 2021. You are not required to take any action. The following is an explanation of the change and when it will occur. 

What Funds Will Be Changed?

The following funds will be replaced:

Current Fund to Be Eliminated	Replacement Fund

Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock U.S. Debt Income Fund F

Vanguard Total Stock Market Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock Russell 3000 Index Fund F

Vanguard Value Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Value Fund F

Vanguard Growth Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 1000 Growth Fund F

Vanguard Mid‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Mid Capitalization Equity Index Fund F

Vanguard Small‐Cap Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock Russell 2000 Index Fund F

Vanguard US‐Real Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock FTSE EPRA/NARIET U.S. Index Fund F

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares	BlackRock MSCI ACWI ex‐U.S. IMI Index Fund F

Vanguard Emerging‐Markets Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares	BlackRock MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund F

If you have invested in any of the current funds listed above, your investments will be moved automatically to the corresponding replacement fund. Your election to have future contributions invested in any of the current funds will also be automatically changed to the corresponding replacement funds. No action on your part is required.

The replacement funds are very similar to the current funds. They are of the same asset class; invest in many of the same securities; and follow a similar, though slightly different, market index. As always, we encourage all Plan participants to review their 401(k) account allocation regularly to confirm that it continues to be compatible with their retirement savings strategy.

Fact sheets for the new funds will be available in early February on the MIT Human Resources website at https://hr.mit.edu/benefits/401k and will also be posted on Fidelity’s NetBenefits website in late February.

When Is the Fund Change Happening?

The fund transfer will be made during the evening of February 22, 2021. Any fund transfers that you request before 4:00 pm EST on February 22, 2021, will be made before the current funds are replaced. Any of your investments that are automatically transferred to the new funds will be available for you to review on the Fidelity NetBenefits website after 7:00 am EST, February 23, 2021.

Why Are the Funds Being Changed?

The Committee regularly reviews the performance and fees of the investment options in the Plan. As part of this due diligence, it compared certain funds in the Plan to outside options with similar characteristics, evaluating their respective performance, index tracking variance, fund transaction costs and fund management fees. After completing its review, the Committee chose to replace the nine funds described above.

Information from Fidelity

Later this week, Fidelity will send you an announcement with detailed information about the fund changes. Please take the time to read the Fidelity announcement so you are fully informed about the changes taking place.

If you have questions, please contact the Fidelity Benefits Center at 877-648-7283 or MIT Benefits at benefits@mit.edu or 617-253-6151.

Something I was just concerned is that when I’m talking to other adMITs, it seems as if all the Course 18s know each other from math competitions/camps, and I haven’t done those things and I’m not currently part of those communities. And while I’ve studied a lot of university-level math in high school, I feel as if I have a weaker foundation since I feel I haven’t studied mathematics in as much depth as other people — though I guess this is a more minor point because I shouldn’t shy away from math just because it’s intimidating.

I’m also interested in the more applied side of things (rather than something like pure math research) and in particular math’s applications in the natural sciences or CS, so I’m thinking about whether a science major would be a better fit for me (or for CS I might just do 18C).

So I guess my main question is, what is the Course 18 experience like for someone who didn’t do traditional math competitions? In general, what kind of person is/is not a good fit for Course 18?",Math culture at MIT,t3_l0fhr6,50.0,0.98,grannysmithapple2

1. What is the difficulty level (from a beginner’s perspective) and the no of recommended hours per week needed for this course (p-sets, assignments etc)? 
2. Will a basic Python introductory course on Codecademy be a good Segway to start 6.001x? 
3. Say I finish 6.001x - would you recommend starting 6.002x immediately? Or work on other projects, apply the concepts in python in other places and then return to take 6.002x

0.0,1608431351.0,27.0,mit,"To the members of the MIT community,

Following the Goodwin Procter report on MIT’s interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, President Reif asked that I create a process to review its findings about Professor Seth Lloyd and to identify any appropriate action. I created a two-part review and decision-making process with two faculty committees: one to review facts and determine, based on those facts, whether Professor Lloyd violated any MIT policy, and the second to recommend disciplinary action, if necessary. I write today to share the results of this intensive two-stage effort and the decision I have reached. 

Before I begin, I would like to emphasize that I am taking the unusual step of sharing this information with our entire community because of the unique public nature of the case and its impacts. Professor Lloyd knows that I am taking this step, and he understands and accepts that the outcome of this disciplinary process should be shared openly.

The Review Panel

I assembled a panel of five senior faculty leaders from across the Institute and asked them to determine if Professor Lloyd violated MIT policies. The members of the panel were Professor Rohan Abeyaratne, Institute Professor Daron Acemoglu, Institute Professor Penny Chisholm, Materials Science and Engineering Department Head Jeffrey Grossman, and Dean of Science Nergis Mavalvala (chair). The panel members reviewed the Goodwin report as well as other documents they deemed relevant and met with a number of individuals, including the Goodwin fact-finders and Professor Lloyd, several times.  

Based on this review, a majority of the members found that, in connection with donations he received from Epstein in 2012, Professor Lloyd violated MIT’s conflict of interest policy (Policies &amp; Procedures 4.4) by failing to inform MIT that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that, in doing so, he violated MIT’s policy on faculty misconduct (Policies &amp; Procedures 3.4.2). A minority of the members could not conclude one way or the other that his actions violated the conflict of interest policy. 

The full panel further determined that he did not violate any MIT policies in accepting a gift from Epstein in 2005–2006 and a donation in 2017. The panel members did not find that Professor Lloyd tried to circumvent the MIT vetting process nor that he sought to conceal the name of the donor. They did conclude, however, that he failed to reveal crucial information about Epstein’s background to anyone at MIT.

The Evaluation Committee

The panel submitted its findings to a separate evaluation committee consisting of Dean of Engineering Anantha Chandrakasan, Mechanical Engineering Department Head Evelyn Wang, Physics Department Head Peter Fisher, Mechanical Engineering Associate Department Head Pierre Lermusiaux, and Faculty Chair Rick Danheiser. The evaluation committee convened several times, including meetings with the review panel members and with Professor Lloyd. Based on the panel’s conclusions, the evaluation committee recommended a set of disciplinary actions, which they stated ""focused on Professor Lloyd’s poor judgment and the impact of his actions on the community, which he may not have yet fully appreciated.""

My Decision

After conferring with senior administrative and faculty leaders, as well as the two committees, I have decided to implement the recommended disciplinary actions. 

For a period of five years, a set of disciplinary actions will limit Professor Lloyd’s compensation, his ability to engage in solicitation of donors and foundations, and his involvement in first-year undergraduate advising, and will impose several other restrictions on normal privileges accorded to a faculty member. In addition, Professor Lloyd will be expected to undergo training on professional conduct before resuming certain activities on campus, including teaching. 

These steps cannot undo the harm done. Professor Lloyd’s failure to share what he knew about Epstein’s conviction when he accepted his 2012 donations was unacceptable. His interactions with Epstein and certain of his actions surrounding acceptance of the donations serve to highlight the importance of the current Institute-wide effort to develop clearer guidelines for engaging with donors. 

I recognize that many in our community remain deeply disturbed by the interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and that some will be disappointed by this decision. In addition, for some, this outcome may renew past pain. If you feel you would benefit from support or guidance at this time, you can find a range of resources here.

I would like to close by extending my gratitude to the entire MIT community for your engagement, your candor, and your care for MIT.

Because this requirement did not exist in the Fall, there are students in other countries with long-term leases, children in schools, spouses with jobs, no visa, US bank account or arrangement for local housing, whose plans are suddenly upended. The text makes clear that this policy change is for bureaucratic convenience of MIT and not a mandate from the government.  Within MIT, the decision was apparently made without consulting the departments. You can imagine how many students are freaking out. 

The new policy is [https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/) but since that site is restricted to MIT users only, I copied relevant text below.

**Graduate Students**  
RA, TAs, and Fellows: ***Graduate students with RA, TA, or fellowship appointments in Spring 2021 are being asked to return/come to the U.S. by January 30, 2021, in order to maintain their appointments***. A graduate student may be eligible to conduct their RA,TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad only if:

* Visa delays, travel restrictions, border closures, and other COVID-related factors prevent their travel to the U.S.; 
* The student or a member of the student’s household has been instructed by a medical provider not to travel to the U.S. for medical reasons; or
* The student is caring for a family member with COVID-19 or other illness.

If a graduate student with an RA, TA, or fellowship appointment is unable to return to/enter the U.S. for the above reasons, and they meet the other criteria listed below (see FAQ), the student should contact their graduate administrator who will submit an [intake form](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6txpJ8RUbGpbY9v) for the student’s remote international appointment.

**These requests will be reviewed individually to determine what options, if any, may be available to the student. Therefore, any student who believes they will need to purse their RA, TA, or fellowship appointment from abroad in Spring 2021 should immediately begin working with their department/program.**

Hourly Paid Appointments: Graduate students are not permitted to have hourly-paid appointments from outside the U.S. during Spring 2021 term. Intake forms should not be submitted for these students.  


**Why is MIT changing its guidelines for remote student appointments conducted from outside the U.S.?**  
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, MIT has supported hundreds of students pursuing their appointments remotely from abroad. As we explained in our [previous guidance and FAQs](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/remote-appointments/), these remote international appointments pose a number of logistical, compliance, and financial challenges for both MIT and those working remotely abroad. To address these challenges, MIT set up a new process in May to review and facilitate these appointments on a temporary basis. The process was updated in August to include specific guidance for the Fall 2020 term.

MIT has reviewed and approved over 800 requests for students to pursue their appointments from outside the U.S. Many of these requests were for students who remained in the U.S at the start of the pandemic, but who wished to return home to pursue their studies and appointments in their home communities.

We are pleased that so many students were able to pursue their appointments this summer and fall from the locations that worked best for them. Unfortunately, given the increasing challenges posed by these international appointments—including the duration of many of these appointments, the fluid situation relating to the pandemic, and the relevant external guidance—we need to modify our approach beginning with the Spring 2021 term.",New residency requirement sprung on graduate students,t3_kalf1i,43.0,0.91,IIistKampos

6.008 intro inference (haven't personally taken, but taught by Greg and Paulina whom I trust to teach a good class)

6.041 intro probability (really good, rigorous, hard class as of spring 2018, but I'm told they changed it so 6.436 might be a better option now)

6.046 intermediate algorithms (supplementary, super fun tho, reminds me why I got into CS)

18.065 linear algebra for ML (taught by Prof. Strang, who both literally and figuratively wrote the book, gives good intuitions and reviews the basics)

6.436 intro probability (again; grad, haven't taken, see note on 6.041)

6.867 classical ML to neural networks (grad, same kind of vibe as Murphy's ML book)

6.438 algorithms for inference (grad, sister class to 6.437 that's more approachable for CS students)

9.520 statistical learning methods (grad, changes content yearly, see CBMM youtube; this class in 2018 had the best explanation of GANs I've ever seen)

6.437 inference and information (grad, my favorite class, not on OCW iirc, one of my friends got a 2/30 on the 3 hour midterm worth 35% that had 3 questions; only Paulina, Greg, and Gauss truly understand this stuff)

6.172 performance engineering (supplementary, great content and projects, lots of stupid small stuff irl)

6.824 distributed systems (supplementary, well put together, but lectures are mostly just rehashing the readings; taught by rtm, who built the first internet worm)

6.803 seminar in ML (grad, legendary class taught by Prof. Winston, tried and failed to get in before he died; may he rest in peace, he truly made the world a better place)

Most are on OCW too I think. You can look at prereqs for a more complete picture, there's some overlap, some classes are taught better than others, start where you feel comfortable, skip what you know, midterms/finals are online for context.

Question: For other classes in prior semesters (e.g. 8.02) there have been methods to anonymously express concerns about a class through the piazza forum. I (and I believe other students also (cf. below)) wish to anonymously express my concerns about 7.06, or to express my concerns in a safe setting. Are there ways in which to do this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Rant: In my opinion, the tests (93% of the grade) in 7.06 are horribly made. For those not in the class this semester, the questions are extremely vague but graded via a hyper-specific rubric while simultaneously docking for any extraneous information (in whatever way they define that based on the rubric, because again, the questions are very vague). For each of the 7.06 exams so far, I think they were content wise easy, and feel like I did well on them. However, each time, I was hit with an extra minus 10-15% for obscure/(extremely) nitpicky reasons. 

I believe students have complained in class about this before, as there was an email from the instructors with a proposed ""solution"" to this problem: to ask clarification questions about vaguely phrased problems DURING the exam via a google forum. In addition to the fact that the onus should not be on the students to design questions well (and that it can take up time that is supposed to be used on solving the exam), this is also unhelpful, as sometimes questions ask about something specific but have supposed rubric ""answers"" containing what I would consider entirely extraneous information. Basically, we don't know what questions to ask about the badly phrased problems because while taking the test they seem normal, only when comparing them with the rubric do they become respectively vague, unintuitive, or unclear.\* \*with respect to what the rubric was looking for 

I have for a little bit now stopped studying the biology for this class as much/attending class and instead focused on trying to figure out what the instructors want from me on tests (this is something I used to do in high school, and I hate that I have to do it now) -- this has actually helped my grade go up, not down. Singlehandedly this class has made me want to change majors as, although I love biology, I don't feel like focusing more on ""test-taking"" than learning in the future.

Dear Faculty Colleagues,

We write to let you know about a decision regarding collaborations  with Aramco, a founding member of the MIT Energy Initiative. After  thorough review and consultations within MIT and Aramco, Aramco’s  membership in MITEI will not be renewed, and new sponsored engagements  between MIT and Aramco will not be considered at this time.

Within MIT, this outcome was informed by extensive consultations and  community input over the past year and a half, and by specific  recommendations from the [International Advisory Committee (IAC)](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/international-advisory-committee), input from the [Ad Hoc Faculty Committee on Guidelines for Outside Engagements](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/ad-hoc-faculty-committee-guidelines-outside-engagements#:~:text=The%20Ad%20Hoc%20Committee%20on%20Guidelines%20for%20Outside%20Engagements%20will,MIT%20community%20during%20Spring%202020.&amp;text=Several%20members%20of%20the%20ad,ensure%20coordination%20in%20their%20work), and review by the Senior Risk Group. A full description of this process appeared in the May issue of the [Faculty Newsletter](https://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/325/lester.html).

Aramco has been a valued research partner for MIT. It is a technical  leader in many areas of engineering and science, and it has provided  many valuable research opportunities for MIT faculty and students which  have contributed to advances in fundamental energy science and  technology. Our researchers have also forged productive individual  working relationships with their Aramco colleagues.

We appreciate the thoughtful consideration that has been given to  this matter by faculty committees and groups and by individual members  of the community.

Sincerely,

Cornell University initially failed to report to U.S. authorities more than $1.2 billion in foreign funds it has received in recent years, including $760 million related to its campus in Qatar and about $1 million in contracts from Chinese telecom company Huawei Technologies Co., the U.S. Education Department indicated in its latest report on schools and foreign contracts.

The names of Cornell and other universities are redacted in a report the department released Tuesday, but are identifiable based on other details provided in the report and related correspondence by the department with the schools.

The 34-page report provides an update to a broad investigation the Education Department undertook last year into whether U.S. universities are appropriately reporting all foreign contracts and gifts that total more than $250,000 in one year. It isn’t illegal to take such funds, but universities are obligated to disclose them under a statute that is decades old but hasn’t been vigorously enforced in past years.

The department said Tuesday it planned to condition access to participation in federal student-loan programs on compliance with foreign-funding obligations.

The government has expressed concern that foreign money may come with strings attached, provide foreign governments improper access to sensitive research or limit academic freedom in some programs.

“U.S. institutions are technological treasure troves where leading and internationally competitive fields, such as nanoscience, are booming. For too long, these institutions have provided an unprecedented level of access to foreign governments and their instrumentalities in an environment lacking transparency and oversight by the industry, the Department, and our partner agencies,” the Education Department said in its report.

More on U.S. Reviews of Foreign Funding

Education Department Investigating Harvard, Yale Over Foreign Funding (Feb. 13)
The Justice Department has been cracking down on violations of a law that requires lobbyists for foreign nationals and governments to publicly disclose that work. A top Republican fundraiser pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a related charge.

Education Department investigators found that “many large and well-resourced institutions of higher education have aggressively pursued and accepted foreign money,” while failing to comply with reporting obligations, according to the new report.

“Evidence suggests institutional decision-making is generally divorced from any sense of obligation to our taxpayers or concern for our American national interests, security, or values,” the report added.

The report said a school, identifiable as Georgetown University, has worked with the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, “derived $2,360,807” from an arrangement that demonstrated “significant intermingling” with China, and supported an academic exchange with Communist officials through the central committee’s Party School.

A Georgetown spokeswoman said the school’s tax filings show a nearly identical dollar amount in expenditures in the region, but not gifts or contracts from foreign entities, and that the details in the report were “a bit puzzling to us.”

U.S. universities have generally defended their international collaborations and said the agency’s reporting requirements were unclear.

A Cornell spokesman acknowledged the university’s past errors in reporting and said it had undertaken significant efforts since July 2019 to file accurate disclosures of the foreign funds.

Since 2019, the Education Department has opened investigations into a dozen top universities including Harvard University and Yale University, finding that U.S. universities failed to report at least $6.5 billion in such funds.

The new report details information the agency received from Georgetown, Texas A&amp;M University, Cornell, Rutgers University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland. The other schools under investigation are continuing to provide information or have yet to provide documents, the report said.

One school, identifiable as Cornell, admitted that it failed to document its institution in Qatar in previous reports to the department, and said it was dumbfounded about how to explain the error, the report said. The university has a branch of its medical school in the Gulf country.

Multiple schools also belatedly reported receiving millions of dollars from Huawei, the report said, referring to the tech giant whose equipment U.S. national security officials have warned could be used for espionage, which the company denies.

American universities largely stopped taking Huawei funds by 2018 based on the U.S. concerns, but many top schools had previously entered into extensive contracts with the company, the report said. The university identifiable as MIT, for example, held around $11 million in contracts and agreements with Huawei since 2013, ranging from research agreements to donations for specific projects and programs, the report said.",MIT and others being investigated for not reporting foreign ties.,t3_jfc4j4,34.0,0.85,bopejbds

So I’m a current freshman here at MIT and just wanted to ask a question. With me wanting to double major in Aerospace Engineering and Physics to try to get both a systems Engineering and technical science background in my undergrad (but also because I love all of it) and after seeing how other students do it successfully without dying, its something I’m pretty set on committing to here at MIT. 

However, I started looking into the Material Science Department here and after poking my head into some of the research labs (MIT Nano) and letting my love for chemistry come out, I’m now considering maybe minoring in Mat Sci along with my double major (because I love Aero/Astro and Physics a lot more).

The way I’m looking at it would be if it gets too stressful and it’s not fun anymore I’d drop it, but what do you guys think about actually trying to do that? I thought it would be awesome to not only get Engineering education, but also a good knowledge base in chemistry and physics as well! 

Would this be a great thing to enter industry with or do you guys think it wouldn’t be worth it?

As part of its pandemic policies, MIT issued a Return to Work on Campus policy, detailing the safety requirements for being on campus, such as completing the daily health attestation and the wearing of face coverings.

To aid in making quick and consistent responses to alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy, MIT will follow a new process, summarized below. This new process (Touchstone login required) applies to allegations against faculty and staff; a similar expedited Committee on Discipline process is in place for allegations against students.

The key provisions are:

Expedited review process

All complaints of alleged violations of the Return to Work on Campus policy are forwarded to the Manager of Institutional Compliance at covidcompliance@mit.edu.
The Manager of Institutional Compliance, in consultation with the OGC and others, will work with the DLC to find facts and appropriately respond.
The alleged violator will be informed and given an opportunity to respond.
Decision making

Low-level violations: DLC will determine appropriate response and/or sanction.
Other violations:
By faculty, other academic, postdoctoral, or research staff: Provost or VP for Research, in consultation with the school dean, will determine response/sanctioning.
By other staff: VP for HR will determine response/sanctioning.
Guidelines for Response/Sanctions

The decision maker – the DLC, Provost, VP for Research, or VP for Human Resources – will refer to the following guidelines when determining the response/sanctions. That said, each case is unique, and these guidelines are not prescriptive; they are intended to offer a basis from which to make a decision about a case. The decision-maker should consider the totality of the circumstances, including aggravating and mitigating factors, when determining sanctions.

 

Type of Violation

Potential Outcome

First-time face covering

Written reminder of policy, and warning that additional violation of this requirement could result in discipline.

 

First time “low level”

Disciplinary written warning.

Second time “low level”

OR

First time “medium level”

One-day disciplinary suspension without pay or access.

Repetition of above categories and
“high level” violations
Five-day disciplinary suspension without pay, or termination of employment. If individual is a tenured faculty member, referral to Provost for appropriate sanction.

 

KEY:

Types of “low-level” violations: one-time face covering or social distancing violation.
Types of “medium-level” violations: one-time access to building without approved access, failure to test, or second incident of a failure to wear a face covering.
Types of “high-level” violations: violating quarantine, repeated violations of the above categories.

From: Suzy M. Nelson, Vice President and Dean for Student Life  
Sent: Monday, September 7, 2020 12:00  
Subject: A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies
 
YOU NEED TO KNOW: off-campus event prohibition; expedited disciplinary process for Covid policy violations; success depends on all of us!

Dear graduate students living off campus,

This is an unusual fall semester as MIT manages a pandemic, and the United States and countries around the world deal with the mounting toll of Covid cases.  Against this backdrop, there is continued unrest in cities across the country in the wake of police violence, systemic inequity, and the deaths of too many Black Americans. Further exacerbating these situations are natural disasters in the country's southern and western regions and a contentious national election.

To all of you anxious about any of these issues, know that MIT is here for you. Please reach out if you need to talk with someone.

MIT's plan for moving forward during the pandemic is guided by science and common sense. As I detail in a message I sent to graduate students living on campus, life at MIT is different now. But, if we work together and adhere to and have patience with Covid policies--both from MIT and in the communities where you live and work now--we can meet the challenges ahead.

Events, parties, and gatherings off campus. Don't organize or attend off-campus events, parties, or gatherings until further notice--they are a leading cause of Covid hotspots on college campuses. MIT will take swift disciplinary action in response to violations of MIT Covid policies through an expedited Committee on Discipline process. Students who attend or host off-campus parties, events, or gatherings may face disciplinary action including potential suspension or loss of future campus access.

Campus Access. Students living off-campus who have not been granted official access to MIT facilities through Covid Pass for academic and research purposes may not be on campus or in campus buildings at any time. Students who do have official access through Covid Pass may use academic and research facilities they are cleared to enter, DAPER indoor and outdoor facilities (with a valid membership), and designated outdoor common areas in groups no larger than the posted occupancy. Only current MIT Housing residents may enter the Student Center and use its foodservice facilities. This chart may help clarify who has access to campus facilities. 

Additional Policies and Updates

As you can see, we take student health, wellness, and safety seriously. Please review The Mind and Hand Book, which contains essential information on standards of behavior and student life policies. Other important policies include:

  - MIT's community standards such as the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act statement;
  - Discrimination, harassment, and Title IX resources that help make our campus safe; and
  - MIT's policy against hazing to support a safe and welcoming environment for all.

The success of the semester depends on every one of us! 

The Institute's decision to stick with our reopening plan is grounded in our confidence that every MIT community member will rise to the challenge.

Our plan for the fall and beyond is being put to the test. Working together, we can pass it with flying colors.

Best,  
Suzy",A different kind of welcome: Fall 2020 Covid policies,t3_ip3hri,11.0,1.0,scaredmitgradstudent

I'm an incoming freshman, and I want to double major in math and physics. I successfully got credit for 18.01 and 18.02 and plan on trying to take the 18.03 ASE, but I'm mostly concerned about physics. In hindsight, I know I made some mistakes on the 8.01 ASE (silly things like forgetting a minus sign, but I'm not sure if I will be heavily docked for this), and, while I did self-study a lot of E&amp;M and Quantum Mechanics, I figured I should probably take the courses since I likely didn't have the same rigor as the MIT courses, especially since my only high school physics course was non-AP (my school didnt offer it) and wasn't particularly rigorous.

So, my question is this: is it still feasible for me to pursue a double major even if I have to start from 8.01? Would I be able to finish in 4 years? Are passing the ASEs important as far as completing the graduation requirements for a major, or do they just free up space for other classes that are taken out of interest rather than necessity?

I'm not sure if the ASEs are right for me, and I hope to get some advice from the MIT community. I'm thinking of premed, so GPA matters quite a bit. 

From my perspective:

Pros of not taking ASEs:

* Easier classes (I could frontload on my major classes and retake my GIRs sophomore/junior year when I'm taking tougher classes)
* Better GPA (I basically know &gt;70% of the material for 8.01, 18.01, 6.0001, and 7.03)
* Solid Foundation (I would not say I've reached complete mastery of 8.01, 18.01, 6.0001, 7.03 material)

0.0,1594954832.0,0.0,mit,"A friend and MIT grad wrote to me yesterday, “I don’t know if the Media Lab is redeemable at all.” This in the wake of the bombshell Ronan Farrow piece in the New Yorker, reporting that the Media Lab under its director Joi Ito had covered up a much closer relationship with Jeffrey Epstein than previously revealed. Ito promptly resigned.

The Media Lab has always occupied a curious place in the tech world. According to itself, it “transcends known boundaries and disciplines by actively promoting a unique, antidisciplinary culture that emboldens unconventional mixing and matching of seemingly disparate research areas … In its earliest years, some saw the Media Lab as a house of misfits. Here, the emphasis was on building; the Lab’s motto was “demo or die.””

It ceased being viewed as a house of misfits a long time ago. Instead it has become perceived as a hyper-prestigious, creme-de-la-creme entity, a weird mixture of counterculture and patrician, seen as home to the best (and coolest) of the best, whose annual budget has tripled from $25 million in 2009 to $75 million in 2019. It seems fair to estimate that roughly a billion inflation-adjusted dollars have been spent on it since its birth in 1986.

While it’s an academic institution it has always been exceptionally business-oriented. “At first glance, much of the Media Lab’s research may seem tangential to current business realities, but for more than 30 years, the Lab has demonstrated that seemingly “far out” research can find its way into the most conventional—and useful—applications … The Media Lab has spawned dozens of new products by our members, and over 150 start-up companies,” to quote, again, them.

And yet. One can’t help but notice. Consider its basic ingredients:

+    founded in 1986, as Moore’s Law began to hit us all, and tech began the exponential growth that has made it the world’s dominant force
+    at the most prestigious technical university on the entire planet
+    in a position to pick and choose from the brightest minds of its generation
+    allotted $1 billion to spend over those thirty years of hockey-stick growth

Given all that, wouldn’t you have expected … well … a whole lot more than what it has actually accomplished?

=== ==== =====

Given all that, wouldn’t you have expected … well … a whole lot more than what it has actually accomplished?

Because that list of accomplishments is surprisingly scrawny. Take its spin-off companies. Here’s its list. Trivia question: how many Media Lab spinoffs have gone public, without merging or being acquired, in its 33 years of existence? As far as I can tell, the answer is one, and even that comes with a sizable asterisk: the Art Technology Group, which didn’t start building products until six years after it spun out (it was a consultancy), IPOd during the first dot-boom, and was eventually acquired by Oracle.

There are companies you’ll recognize on that list. Well, there’s one: BuzzFeed. Yes, really. There are a few others of note. Harmonix, makers of Rock Band. Makani Power, acquired by Alphabet six years ago. Elance, which became Upwork and then had its platform phased out. Jana. Formlabs, Otherlab, The Echo Nest, all of which I think are great, but none of which I would have heard of if not for some personal connections. One Laptop Per Child, a bad idea a decade ago and a forgotten one now. And, notably, E Ink, the Media Lab’s one definite, unambiguous big win … back in 1996.

It’s not nothing, but it’s so much less than you’d expect, given its ingredients. It’s certainly no Bell Labs, or Xerox PARC, or even Y Combinator, and I say that as someone who is less of a YC enthusiast than most of the Valley.

OK, I hear you arguing, but they’re a basic research facility! Spinoff companies are not their true measure of success! Sure. Fine. So let’s take a hard look at their own list of their top 30 tech products or platforms (PDF). Aside from E Ink — which, again, was 23 years ago — doesn’t that look a lot like a list of occasionally interesting, but fundamentally limited and/or niche, technologies? Doesn’t it seem rather utterly devoid of any significant impact on the world?

Wouldn’t you have expected so, so much more?

Criticisms that the Lab is more about style and sizzle than serious substance are not exactly new. Nor are they old: here’s a piece condemning its recent “personal food computer” as smoke and mirrors that doesn’t actually work. This “Hunter S. Negroponte” piece dates back to the 1990s. It’s satire, but if you read it, you’ll likely find you can’t help but raise your eyebrows and wonder just how far back the Media Lab’s systemic problems go.

Maybe if it hadn’t been a “plutocratic friendocracy,” to quote former Media Lab faculty, and it had actually systemically favored the best and brightest and most innovative, regardless of background or personal connection — maybe then things would have been very different. Maybe it would actually have been what it pretended to be for all this time.",E15,t3_hso1py,0.0,0.49,xesus2021

Has anything been announced of the extent to which it would be possible to be remote in the spring?

Normally I would just live in Cambridge, but given that Cambridge is relatively expensive, much of the MIT community will not be there, and access to MIT facilities will be limited, I don't really see the point if things are remote.  Obviously I am willing to move to Cambridge, but would prefer if possible not to commit to a 1 year lease in Cambridge only to find that everything is remote.

Curious if anyone here or anyone’s friends have been trying to set up a Social Impact Work-Study with PKG this summer.

I was really counting on this because my MISTI travel was cancelled due to COVID. I found an internship and jumped through all the hoops for this PKG program, only to get it denied halfway through this pandemic summer. PKG is offering a small amount of money to make up for it, but it’s a fifth of what I was supposed to make, and way too late. I didn’t get paid for all of June!

I’m also worried about transitioning to MIT without the support of a solid friend group.       
        
However, the main thing that’s stopping me from requesting one right now is that I don’t know what I would do during a gap year. A lot of the usual gap year activities (e.g. internships, travel, getting a job) seem difficult to do during a pandemic. I know there’s the option of studying through OCW and then taking more ASEs after the gap year, but my brain is telling me I need to do something more productive than that.

International students are too big of a cash cow for universities to let go.

=======

Regardless of whether the deportation order is legal it is indisputably an incredibly dumb policy move. These are exactly the people there is near universal agreement we want to attract to and incentivize to stay in the country. They are the least likely to become wards of the state and most likely to fill needed gaps in the highly skilled sectors of the job market.


======

This is so frustrating to see. As a student I’ve switched from online to seated over the semesters. So these students would be deported for a semester then next semester when they take one seated they’d be allowed to come back, but then the following semester if they take all online they’d be deported again? Sounds like a huge waste of time and people’s money traveling that much. Especially since we are in new territory and who knows how long universities will be doing mostly online, this may go on for a couple semesters.


=====

Are international students who take online only courses normally granted F1 visas?  No, but international students who take courses at Harvard and MIT are, and Harvard and MIT don't normally go 100% online.

And as the complaint lays out, ICE actually provided exceptions to that policy for the second half of the spring 2020 semester, by explaining that its typical rules should not apply throughout the ""duration of the emergency.""

 [Williams College](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/780717Z:US), the richest liberal arts school in the U.S., is reducing its cost by 15% for families on a one-time basis for the coming academic year and canceling sports competition and travel for the season as the coronavirus upends higher education.

The changes come “in recognition of the extraordinary circumstances and of this academic year and the uncertainty we face in the year ahead,” the Williamstown, Massachusetts, school said in a [statement](https://president.williams.edu/writings-and-remarks/letters-from-the-president/announcing-our-plan-for-fall-2020/) Monday. 

“This reduction recognizes the fact that the pandemic and associated challenges are requiring us to cancel winter study as well as fall athletics competition and many student activities, among other opportunities that we usually encourage families to expect as part of their student’s education,” school President Maud Mandel said.

Schools across the U.S. are coping with uncertainty for the year that begins in August or September as it’s largely unclear whether in-person courses will be offered given the rise in Covid-19 cases. Students at dozens of schools have already balked at the full price for last semester’s tuition with months of online classes, suing for billions of dollars in refunds.

“In higher education, we’re trained to believe that expensive is good,” said [Robert Kelchen](https://www.shu.edu/profiles/robertkelchen.cfm), an associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University. “Now, in this economic crisis, families are more price-sensitive than they have been.”

The move by Williams, which has about 2,100 students, may put pressure on other selective liberal arts schools to follow.

“For this year, it may be less expensive for the colleges to do because a lot of students who pay full price are international students, and they may not be counting on them,” Kelchen said.",Williams College decreases tuition by 15% for 2020-21 academic year,t3_hiehfp,43.0,0.87,LeadOn

0.0,1592125317.0,6.0,mit,"Throwaway to avoid persecution, but I just watched the documentary of Jeffrey Epstein on Netflix... absolutely disgusting. Not only him but also all the collaborators. After doing some research about the consequences to the other players in this story, it came to my attention the role played by MIT. In particular the support to Jeffrey Epstein and the lack of regrets shown by the institution and its members.

It came ta my attention, in particular, the role of MIT Media Lab and Joi Ito, who was fired. But my surprise was the story of  Neri Oxman, whose work has been produced with money from a network of pedophilia, and she still teaching in MIT and representing the values of the institution!

For those who don't know the story, Jeffrey Epstein supported her work through donations, AFTER he was charged the first time for child trafficking, and he was a known child abuser. Apparently, his strategy was to donate to many people with good reputation but lacking ethical principles, to present himself as a philanthropist to the judge. When the money started flowing to the lab, one of his students told her that he felt uncomfortable using such money. She lied, telling him that she had ensured that no money from Epstein was being used. So, the students, who demonstrated more ethical values than her, continued working. Later it was discovered that she accepted the money with the condition that nobody knew, but not only she knew but also lied to her students to use them, and MIT resources, to produce presents for a pedophile, so money keeps flowing.

So, if you went to MIT, there are some chances you made presents for convicted (but wealthy) pedophiles.

MIT did nothing, tried to hide everything under the carpet, and had her superstar professor as an example of women in STEM. Remember, if you are a woman in STEM, MIT thinks the model you should follow is that everything is allowed, even if everything means supporting sexual abuse of girls.

I'm still confused about how MIT as an institution or its students and faculty bodies have decided to look away instead of on deeply clean your institution. But MIT is not the only one, surprisingly Netflix, who just made a 4 hours documentary to denounce Jeffery Epstein's case, did it a few months after releasing a chapter of Abstract highlighting the work of your beloved MIT professor. A work produced with money from a known pedophile by someone who knew the origin of the money! Cynicism over 9000!

The tolerance to child abuse by MIT is disgusting and disappointing. So, next time that you walk in the Media Lab and see the last artistic installation of one of your professors at the Media Lab lobby think about this: that has been built with money from child abuse.

------------------------------------------------------------------
### My experience with the FEE: Utter Failure.

I've spoken English my whole life. In the summer of 2008, I had to do the Freshman Essay Evaluation.

The topics were enjoyable to read and think about: The security of electronic voting machines and the ethics of paying human research subjects.

I could not do the writing. No words onto paper. No words onto keyboard. I..... just. could. not. write.
This had happened to me before. I sat for hours in my room, trying to get words to come out. None.
Usually, after enough time digging my nails into my skin, mentally shouting at myself to just buckle down and get it done, and eventually some tears.... something would unblock and I'd be able to write a first draft. Never any time to edit it, but oh well.

That summer, after 9 days of misery, I turned in nothing.

I figured that I'd learn to overcome this by taking the technical writing class at MIT. Fun fact: no. The professor who teaches that class is _not_ a psychotherapist. Neither are the staff of the MIT writing center.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Correct, non-actionable advice: Just get words onto paper.

Good writing comes from editing -- molding clay into solid bricks and stacking them on top of each other. You need to have some words and paragraphs to mould and push into a good structure.

People will often phrase this as ""Don't care what someone would think; Just write a [crappy first draft](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf) to get your thoughts on paper"". Fun fact: no. If you only imagine yourself doing a crappy job, you will not be very motivated to do it.

So how do you get some clay? How do you lead your brain to make the words? 

------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to actually execute that: Have a conversation.

Brains do things that they find rewarding.

If you have writers' block, you might notice that you're perfectly fine talking with a human about the topic. That is because you can see the social reward in real time. You're turning vague notions into organized thoughts for the benefit of another person and (if they are paying attention to you), you can see their understanding. You might be fine texting someone or getting on reddit and commenting on a thread. Same thing: You imagine them listening to what you say and reacting.

Notice that commenting on reddit is a form of writing. Notice you're not writing crap, You're having a conversation. Even if you're shitposting, you're just having a boisterous conversation.

If you do this over IM with someone who is interested in the topic or prompt, you can then copy-paste your words and have the clay to mold into an essay.

If you do this over audio and record it (especially with an auto-transcription app like [otter](https://otter.ai/), you can kinda do the same.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### What to do if you can't talk to someone -- Reward Loops 

I am a software engineer and we have technique for writing code even when we're worried that it will be crap or we don't know how it should be structured.

#### Test Driven Development

The technique is to repeat some small simple steps:

1. Write a program that does literally nothing.

2. Write a tiny program to check if the first program does a tiny bit.

3. The second program is a ""test"". Run it so you know that it says ""nope"".

4. Change the first program to do a tiny bit.

5. Run the test to see that it says ""yep"". Feel successful. 😃

6. Write a third tiny program to check if the first program does a tiny bit more.

7. Run this new test to see that it says ""nope.""

8. Add a tiny bit more to your first program...

Continue like this, writing tests and first running them so you know that they actually say ""nope"" when a feature is missing or buggy. You end up with the program you want and a bunch of tiny programs that automatically check that it works.

Notice that this technique keeps putting a small step of a goal right in front of you, letting you try things and observe the results, and showing you when you succeed at it.

[This is the same thing that video games do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGL5YGcAxEI&amp;t=22).

#### How to start a core reward loop for writing.

In order to feel rewarded for making progress, you need to imagine that you're succeeding at something. 

Succeeding at what? An essay asks you to answer a question. 

So type your own question and respond to it. Type the first response that comes to mind, even if that is another question. Just keep responding, writing questions guided by your curiosity or confusion and answers as you see them. 

Set a 10-minute [timer](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/) before you start this. 

At the end of the 10 minutes, notice if any questions seem relevant to the assignment. Copy those to a new page and start again. If your questions are along the lines of ""Why am I such a lazy piece of shit?"", then save that file somewhere else, open a new page, then get up and go for a walk or do some exercise. Come back to this with a fresh mindset.

Just keep typing questions and answers. You'll likely notice yourself wanting to give longer explanations to the questions and wanting to re-frame the questions. Once you've started doing that, you're plugged-in: you've begun to imagine a conversation partner and what they need to hear to satisfy their curiosity. You've got your reward model and it has started giving you incremental signs-of-success.

[There is a reason why Plato wrote the Dialogues as...a dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_dialogue#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20Socratic%20dialogues,which%20Socrates%20is%20a%20character.)

[There is a reason why the first great works of literature come from oral tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry)

Writing is a technology we humans had to build _on top of conversation_.

So keep the conversation going and you'll soon have enough hefty concepts for a first draft. Feel free to lengthen that timer from 10 minutes to 20 or 30 in the style of the [pomodoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0k0TQfZGSc). After several paragraphs, you might find yourself getting a bit confused and wanting to re-structure your sections so they make more sense to you. That is fine to do. You might want to make side-notes on a piece of physical paper or draw a diagram. Thats cool too. Just keep moving and keep a regular rhythm of checking in on yourself to see if you're still having a conversation that might be relevant. You are making clay. It is fine that some of it won't be used.

### A note about the question ""Why"".

Yes, this does mean that you might start out asking ""why does anybody care?"" about the assignment. You might have previously asked a teacher and heard ""Just write the essay."" Your parent might have told you ""Because I said so"". You might have learned to stifle asking ""Why?"" in certain situations. 

You are now an adult. 

Your whole life is optional.^([1])

You have the freedom to pursue an answer to ""Why"". No particular person is obligated to answer you, but you can go ask someone else.

You can also just decide not to do something if you don't find a compelling reason for doing it.

Minoring in both economics and philosophy sadly doesn't work, and I don't have enough space to both major in philosophy and concentrate in economics (or double major in economics).

On the one hand, I think economics could be more practical. I eventually want to have a career in the tech industry that is more people and business-orientated, and I think economics could help with the initial understanding of fundamental concepts in business.

On the other hand, 14.01 was very mathematical, and I presume much of the other classes in economics are similarly so. I could see a lot of value in having a HASS double major that trains me in a different way of thinking, in oral/written communication, and in reflecting more deeply about the implications of the products and services that I create. Furthermore, I am considering quite seriously to pursue an M.Eng, which I believe won't be available for 6-14.

**What We Know Now**

*During these uncertain times, some things are already clear and should be factored into the design and implementation of any option for the future. Below, we list some of them:* 

* MIT must meet all federal, state, and city requirements and adhere to public health orders. We will benchmark our planning and practices against the current guidance from other credible and relevant sources.
   * [Massachusetts COVID-19 Reopening Guidance](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/reopening-massachusetts)
   * [Public Health Principles for a Phased Reopening During COVID-19: “Guidance for Governors”; April 17, 2020](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200417-reopening-guidance-governors.pdf)
   * [American College Health Associationʼs Guidelines: Considerations for Reopening Institutions of Higher Education in the COVID-19 Era Guidance](https://www.acha.org/documents/resources/guidelines/ACHA_Considerations_for_Reopening_IHEs_in_the_COVID-19_Era_May2020.pdf) 
* The implementation of testing, tracing, and treatment protocols is essential to mitigating the risk of community spread of COVID-19.
* There will be ongoing physical distancing in classroom, research lab, residential, and work spaces. 
   * Roughly 100 fall subjects rely on access to the physical campus space to achieve the subject learning objectives. Roughly 3,000 students enroll in these subjects in a typical year. Physical distancing constraints in our instructional spaces will limit the in-person teaching that can be done on campus, and require that we teach and learn in different ways (e.g., fewer students at a time in teaching labs, design studios, project, and performance spaces and potential for broader use of the day for class hours).
   * Much of the curriculum (lectures, recitations, seminars) will be offered remotely in the fall and perhaps the spring as well, even when some or many students may reside on campus.
   * In the undergraduate residence halls, use of common spaces will be limited, food service options will include take-out services, and cook-for-yourself programming will likely be suspended during this period. P-setting and interactions with peers, house team members, and GRAs will be highly constrained under physical distancing. Recreational programming will be online or offered in de-densified settings. Access to common amenities such as gyms, lounges, and study rooms will be limited.
   * On-campus office spaces in which staff interact with faculty, students, and other staff (e.g., DSL headquarters, DAPER check-in, OVC headquarters, SFS, S\^3, OGE, MIT Medical, etc.) will need to be revamped to facilitate physical distancing. Examples include removing some furniture and chairs, putting up Plexiglass barriers and tape in lobby areas, and removing vending machines and reusable kitchen items. 
* Ongoing restricted access to MIT buildings will be necessary.
   * The campus will be allocated into sectors that will be entered by MIT ID-card based access. This will be less convenient and will require more planning to oneʼs day when coming to campus buildings to use on-campus resources. MIT is testing and adapting such approaches now with the existing on-campus population of residents, approved researchers, and campus support staff. 
* Not everyone will be able to or will choose to return to campus, even if permitted to do so. 
   * Some people fall into a high health risk category for COVID-19 or live with people who are high risk. Every member of the MIT community must do their part to protect these members of our community. Others may be impeded from being on campus due to travel restrictions and visa delays. Still other community members may have unique living situations where teaching, learning, and/or working are made more difficult by technology barriers, family responsibilities, and financial challenges. We must be agile and able to make arrangements for individuals who are remote.
   * The limited availability of MIT-owned residential beds in a de-densified campus setting poses a significant constraint. The Division of Student Life estimates the availability of 1,900 beds at one student per room and a 3:1 student/water closet ratio. Securing hotel beds may increase our capacity figures but doing so adds significant costs and presents potential negative implications for the student experience. 
* We will maintain our commitment to high-quality education, student support, and co-curricular and experiential learning opportunities in every option. We will revise academic policies and regulations to respond to the plan that is ultimately put in place.
   * Consistent with MITʼs mission, we will deliver “an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery”. We will ensure that students progress towards their degrees, minimize subject cancellations, and minimize pre-requisite disruptions. We have developed optimization methods to rapidly re-plan class schedules to achieve our objectives. 
* We will maintain our commitment to excellence in research and [graduate education](https://covid19.mit.edu/safe-gradual-return-to-campus-for-graduate-students). [The research ramp up process is designed to ensure this objective.](https://covid19.mit.edu/initial-process-for-on-campus-research-ramp-up)
* Creating a dedicated isolation space for students and other campus residents who test positive for COVID-19 is necessary in any of the scenarios being considered, as is a plan to scale back the reopening if community health and safety concerns necessitate a reduction in campus density levels again.

**What We Donʼt Know Yet**

*There are certain things we cannot know or guarantee at this moment, and there are certain questions we havenʼt answered yet. Any option for the fall and beyond will have several uncertainties in common, including:*

* The trajectory of the pandemic and the timeline for the development of a cost-effective, widely available vaccine and/or therapeutics.
   * We donʼt know what the public health situation will be within the city or state in the fall, including when or if a second wave will occur, when a vaccine or therapeutics will be available or once available, if we will be able to procure large enough quantities to immunize the entire community. Nevertheless, we must be prepared for dramatically changing health conditions in the next academic year (positive or negative). 
   * Based on what we know now, antibody testing is not likely to be helpful in the short to medium term for planning for return to campus but [may be helpful eventually](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19).   
* Community membersʼ willingness to comply with physical distancing rules in classroom, research lab, residential, and work spaces. 
   * We donʼt know how well students and the rest of the MIT community will follow physical distancing policies; some current residents would like [stricter rules, and others would like more relaxed rules](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6oqkxb6gipquxj/strengthen%20or%20relax%20housing%20policies.pdf?dl=0). 
* Who will be allowed to travel to campus, and the best decisions for which undergraduate students will return and when for options where only a fraction of the undergraduates are on campus at a given time.
   * For any case where only a fraction of the undergraduates are invited back to campus over a given period, we will have to make difficult choices about who to bring to campus and when, but we will seek to equally support and serve all of our students. We will also optimize our subject schedules to increase the ability of students to take the classes they need to progress academically. 
* Space availability to enable physical distancing on campus (in our academic spaces and undergraduate residence halls).
   * At current physical distancing guidelines, and taking into account the varied types of learning spaces and learning activities in MIT classes, we estimate that the academic campus can accommodate approximately 4,000 learners at a time. We could think of this as 4,000 students in classrooms/labs/studios/seminar rooms per day; or 8,000 if each student had a half-day on campus. Scheduling and judicious use of the hands-on-campus resource for in-person educational opportunities (e.g. lab, project and performance classes, design studios) for those who can be on campus will be important.  
   * Even as lectures, recitations, seminars, and large group gatherings are delivered remotely, individuals who choose to be on campus may benefit from physically-distanced, in-person interactions among others wearing face coverings, in medium-sized and large spaces (e.g., psetting, office hours, working on projects, practicing performances, etc.). Such spaces and the management of appropriate population density are under consideration now. 
   * We donʼt yet know how we will house and room residential students in a de-densified scenario and may need to explore the implications of securing hotel spaces and keeping some buildings (e.g., Burton Conner and Eastgate) in use to house graduate students, undergraduate students, and/or as isolation space. Nor do we know when the Site 4 and New Vassar residence halls will open following construction delays, but anticipate this will not be until January at the earliest (these buildings provide \~450 beds each of additional capacity).
* Short and long-term impacts on the wellbeing of community members.
   * While we will make every effort to create a positive and special living community on campus, some individuals may feel more isolated and have difficulties coping with the new normal. Others may have difficult living situations off-campus if they are remote.
* Short and long-term impacts on the residential education model and experience and co-curricular learning.
   * There are uncertain impacts on internships, and travel-related learning.
   * We donʼt know the extent of necessary changes to the academic calendar and curriculum. 
* Community responses and reactions to the options.
   * We donʼt know how many undergraduate and graduate students may wish to defer, take a leave of absence, or stay remote under the conditions in which MIT has to operate this fall. In a recent survey, [when asked about the housing options they were exploring for fall](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnzthf4xbxc3xhz/housing%20options%20students%20are%20exploring.pdf?dl=0), about a quarter of continuing undergraduates checked “I would probably stay where I am now if MIT has online instruction and reduced campus operations (e.g., restricted access to campus; emergency housing policies).”    
 

**Steps MIT Can Take**

*Keeping in mind the* [*guiding principles*](https://covid-team2020.mit.edu/principles-values/) *and logistical, temporal, and financial realities, the following are examples of steps that MIT could decide to take that might impact the viability of the potential options.*

* Consider requiring [regular, community-wide testing, tracing, and treating](https://idss.mit.edu/research/idss-covid-19-collaboration-isolat/)
   * Consider requiring testing on arrival/re-entry to campus and periodically thereafter. MIT Medical would be able to collect specimens for up to 5,000 viral tests per week.
   * Consider requiring  use of a contact tracing app to facilitate testing, tracing, and treating [if we could ensure that it was accurate and could protect privacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01264-1).
   * Continue to provide quarantine spaces and care for students and other campus residents who have a positive COVID-19 test.
   * Continue to integrate the evolving information and protocols published in the literature into our processes for any testing, tracing, and treating as feasible and appropriate.
* Adopt new policies, procedures, and educational campaigns that promote recommended practices and support compliance with public health guidelines:
   * Enhance access to hand washing stations, hand sanitizer, face coverings and work activity-specific PPE; required access control for spaces, etc. consistent with our policies.
   * Enhance cleaning and stocking by staff who maintain facilities (e.g., more frequent cleaning and sanitizing schedule, restocking sanitizing wipe and hand sanitizer stations, etc.).
   * Establish and communicate work-at-home policies and expectations.
   * Establish and communicate expectations and protocols for being on campus (e.g., conduct meetings electronically, even when on campus; requirement to wear a face covering in any shared space; practice physical distancing; criteria to be eligible to return to campus; reminders through signage; training on new expectations; using health monitoring technology; etc.).
   * Redesign spaces to help maintain physical distance (e.g., remove furniture and chairs; Plexiglass barriers; removing vending machines and reusable kitchen items).
   * Establish remote, hybrid, and physically-distanced teaching, learning, and working options. 
* Teach, learn, and work in new modalities. 
   * The entire MIT community responded quickly and effectively on short notice to the pandemic in spring 2020. Going forward, we will have more time to carefully plan and prepare. We will continue to invest in existing and new academic and well-being support structures for our students; this includes, for example, our [student success coaches](http://news.mit.edu/2020/student-coaching-calls-pandemic-0501) and [other virtual support resources](https://covid19.mit.edu/virtual-student-support-resources).
   * We will redesign not only our formal curriculum but also co-curricular and experiential learning opportunities (e.g., UROP) so that we will continue to offer these exceptional parts of the MIT experience. For classes and experiences that typically require and rely on access to the physical campus space to achieve the subject learning objectives, we can explore and offer alternatives (e.g., mailing kits of parts home). 
* Implement a phased or staggered campus repopulation plan.
   * We can strictly limit visitors to campus. 
   * We plan to ramp up the research enterprise under the following parameters:
      * Reduced occupancy and density levels for our buildings and labs as prescribed by our medical and public health professionals. PI and DLC operating plans will align and be benchmarked against these levels. 
      * Only researchers and staff needing to use the physical campus will be allowed back during the ramp-up process. Clearly, this need is subjective and thus a period of comment and discussion with the faculty is underway to plan phases of research ramp up that would increase the number of MIT ID holders coming to campus to conduct research each day. Researchers and staff who can work remotely will continue to do so until conditions as determined by our medical and health professionals allow them to return to campus. 
      * Individual PIs and DLCs will be empowered to structure their research activities in response to these new occupancy and density levels. Priority should be given to activities that can easily be scaled up or scaled down if necessary.
      * Core facilities, shared resources, and other services will be made available to facilitate research activities broadly, provided they can function safely and within the predetermined limits regarding occupancy and density.
      * Access to buildings (and, where possible, individual spaces within buildings) will adhere to approved PI personnel plans; only those individuals who are approved to enter buildings will be allowed to do so and will do so through specific building access locations and protocols.
      * Anyone who chooses to participate in on-campus research can be supplied with face coverings or PPE if needed. Face coverings or masks will be required to be worn while working in MIT buildings. On-campus personnel will follow physical distancing protocols as described in PI space planning documents and DLC plans for common spaces. They can also submit to a daily health attestation as well as possible health monitoring and testing.
      * Researchers, students, and staff returning to campus to conduct or support research may be expected to enroll in an online environmental, health, and safety training course to learn about how to maintain a safe and clean work environment in the current COVID-19 era conditions. 
* Create and promote new modes of operating for student life and hands-on learning opportunities as well as community-building programs.
   * New virtual study lounges and other study spaces (remote and physically-distanced in person) could be used to promote academic belonging, peer-learning, and camaraderie. 
   * New campus organizations and events (e.g., discussion groups, representative bodies, etc.) can help anticipate and manage the range of issues that will arise in a physically distanced academic year. 
* Adapt MITʼs business operations to all options.
   * Essential campus services must be staffed according to acceptable campus density parameters and guidelines for safe working conditions and safe commuting. The research ramp-up plans, educational plans, and other MIT programs cannot create an unacceptable burden on these functions or these campus service staff.  
 

**Important Things to Consider for All Options**

*We realize that assessing the information on this site is, in MIT tradition, like drinking from a firehose. With that in mind, the list below succinctly presents the most crucial factors that informed our analysis of options and will need to be heeded in any adaptation to those options or in developing new ones.*

**Health Risk**

* Health risk to the MIT community 
* Health risk to the broader community beyond campus  
 

**Education and Student Experience**

* Quality of educational offerings  
* Quality of lab, project-based, performance classes, and other academic experiential learning (e.g., UROP)
* Student academic progression (e.g., numbers of potential schedule dislocations)
* Extracurricular and residential education (e.g., clubs, organizations, athletics, FSILGs, etc.)
* Impacts on student life goals (e.g., desire to be with friends, experience the campus, distributional impacts)
* Equity impacts on students, staff, and faculty
* Impact on residential operations 
* Impact on FSILGs (fewer students will live in FSILG housing, and FSILG leaders and alumni are working with MIT to consider how housing in FSILGs will work in the various options being considered for the upcoming academic year)  
 

**Implementation**

* Ease of public health protocol implementation
* Ease of curricular implementation
* Ease of implementation behaviorally
* Preparedness for a ramp-up (e.g., in the event of a vaccine)
* Preparedness for rapid wind-down (e.g., in the event of a second wave of cases)
* Confidence in planning estimates
* Impacts on faculty/staff (e.g. workload, different working hours)  
 

**Broader Institute Impacts**

* Financial sustainability 
* Reputational impacts 
* Longer-term impacts (e.g., deferrals)
* Cambridge/Boston community economic impact",MIT thinking about next year,t3_gq19y8,42.0,0.97,IIistKampos

Essentially this means that if you are an international student who is currently in the US, you have to stay in the US until you graduate (up to ""holidays"") or MIT won't pay you.

What I have been able to find out about this policy change so far:

\-This policy was quite likely forced on MIT by US immigration (vote!).

\-Students who want to return home in spite of this should be able to if they take a leave of absence for a semester, the issue is with paying students rather than the state of an F-1 or J-1 visa.

If anyone knows anything more on this, please leave a comment. If they can find anywhere on the MIT website where this change has been announced that would also be appreciated!

Edit: should be the US, not MA.

I know MIT is generally a really collaborative environment, but there's a stereotype of finance majors elsewhere being snaky, competitive, or too focused on networking to make real connections. Do you find this to be true at MIT?

I've seen jokes made about people at Sloan and am wondering whether that's just a joke or whether there's actually some real resentment between Sloanies and not-Sloanies. If so, do you feel that it's justified?

Do you find that the relative smartness of people here and the difficulty of the courses make it harder to find career opportunities?

Please add your own suggestions! This list is not comprehensive or complete. It is just restaurants I have gone to and remembered atm.

&amp;#x200B;

* Cambridge Based
   * Five Spice | $$
      * Best and closest mala xian guo place near MIT. The food there is great and the price is very affordable. My go-to place for a long lunch during the day due to its proximity.
   * Mysterious White Food Truck Area 4 | $ - $$
      * It's shady but it's good. I don't know how they make it so good but the food truck parks right in front of Area 4 most days and there is always a line. It is a fast, cheap, delicious way to keep your stomach full especially if you have a tight schedule.
   * L'Verdes | $
      * Will fill you up. Will also take away your soul. Atleast if you get 10 subs they give you a free one.
   * Anna's Tacqueria | $ - $$
      * Is food. Will fill up stomach. Tastes decent I guess. Not a big fan of this kinda of food myself. Alot of people get it nevertheless. Good if you don't have time for anything else.
   * Thelonious Monkfish | $$ - $$$
      * Very expensive. It has sushi boats, fish dons and etc. Good place to bring your date. Wouldn't really go casually tho.
   * HMart Go Go Curry | $$
      * Amazing curry. It is fast, tastes good, and is in HMART so you'll be able to pick up snacks along the way.
   * HMart Sakura Ramen | $$
      * Same thing as Harambe curry. Closest ramen place to campus
   * Dumpling Daughters | $$
      * Pretty good asian food. I appreciate how clean it is and how efficient they make your food.  I like the food but it does not remind me of the stuff I normally eat, esp since alot of the stuff is premade.
   * Chipotle | $ - $$
   * Area 4 | $$
      * Good pizza place(heard from others). It is very close to campus. Never been there myself though.
   * The Smokeshop | $$
      * I really like their smoked meats and their sauce. The price is a little bit on the higher side but it definitely a change of taste compared to the other restaurants named here. I personally think it is worth it.
   * The Friendly Toast | $ - $$
      * A really friendly breakfast diner that makes amazing comfort food. 
   * Roxy's | $$
      * A close-by grilled cheese joint with great tots. I would personally think it is a lil overpriced esp the tomato soup but the taste definitely makes up for it.
   * Oath's | $$
      * Make your own pizza. Never enjoyed it but it is a good eat once in a while.
   * Saloniki's | $ - $$
      * Amazing pitas at this greek restaurant. It is probably as close to campus as you can get. The food is cheap and amazing. Students get free fries if shown ID.
   * Taco Bell  | $
      * \+1 rep for taste, -1 rep for diarrhea
   * Helmand  | $$ - $$$
      * Kinda expensive Afghan restaurants. Their lamb is amazing and I would definitely suggest trying here.
   * Pepper Sky | $$
      * Amazing Thai food. Although I never went there personally, ever club orders it for events.
   * McDonalds | $ - $$
      * Only for late-night shenanigans
   * Dumpling House | $$
      * Amazing Asian restaurant that is also very cheap. Comparable to 5 spice although I think Dumpling house is a little bit better. The only downside is its really up Mass Ave(closer to Harvard than MIT)
   * 430 Tavern | $$
      * Go here for Boston dine out week. The steak tip lunch is amazing, the meat is perfectly tender and the asparagus is amazingly seasoned.
* Boston Based
   * Santouka  | $$
      * The best ramen you'll find near campus. It is a 20 minute walk over the bridge. The line is very long so prepare for a wait. Do make sure to go in duos or by yourself since larger groups take longer to seat. (There is another one in Harvard that will seat you faster). Go here on a date lol
   * Kaju Tofu | $$
      * Amazing tofu soup place. My go-to place to eat when I'm in Boston. Definitely try this place out. Always get an egg in your soup.
   * Hsin Hsin's | $(lunch menu) - $$
      * Really cheap asian food that will give you diabetes or cancer. It tastes good but eat at your own risk.
   * Chef Chang | ?
      * Apparently the noodles are good? Never been before
   * Love Art Sushi | $$
      * Make your own sushi don place. It also offers hand rolls. I ate it a lot over the summer. The price is pretty affordable even with UROP pay.
   * Pad Thai Cafe | $ - $$
      * One of my favorite pad thai places I been to. I like the Indonesian Fried Rice alot. They give you alot of food compared to what you pay.
   * Wendy's | $ - $$
      * I love Wendy's chili's and baconator. What can I say.
   * Boston Burger Company | $$
      * Amazing burgers! Most of the burgers are very fatty and greasy and is impossible to fit in your mouth but it is soooo good. If you go at 4:20, the 420 burger(literally obesity burger) only costs 4.20.
   * Pour House | ?
      * ??? people I know always want to go so it must be good right???
   * Peach Farm | $$
      * Decent asian food place. Not sure if its worth the price since there are so many others which are better.
   * Dumpling Palace | $ - $$
      * This is the one on Mass Ave. The food is really bad. Go there if you're drunk and need to fill up your stomach
   * Haruka Ramen | $$
      * Outwayed by Santouka. It's not a proper ramen place since it also sells other noodles. Overall the quality is not that good. Source: my mom
   * Gourmet Dumpling House | $$
      * There is usually a long wait. The food is really good here especially the dumplings and xiao long bao. Would suggest going here, maybe on a date
   * Taiwan Cafe | $$
      * Can't actually remember much. It is average asian food. Nothing too particular but nothing too bad.
   * Dumpling Cafe | $$
      * Also average asian food. 
   * Double Chin | $$
      * I've only been here once. The food was okay. I went with my gf and I never thought about going back. If invited I would go back but I wouldn't go out of my own choice. Wasn't too memorable
   * Penang | $$
      * I always liked Penang even at home. I like the shrimp noodles but it is definitely an average restaurant taste wise.
   * Pho Pasteur | $$
      * Argued to be the best pho place in Boston. greatly debated
   * Pho Basil | $$
      * On Mass Ave. Another Pho place but this one is closer to campus. The food is good, especially if you want Viet food. The distance to campus is a plus but the taste is a bit lower than Pho Pasteur.
   * Hei La Moon | $$
      * Great dim sum place. Go here with a group and you'll have fun.
   * Tora Japanese Restaurant | $$
      * Amazing sushi/fish don. I discovered this by accident and it is a kinda small and in the ground. But don't be deceived. It is very clean inside and the taste is A1.
   * Quic Pic BBQ | $ - $$
      * I came here when I was hungry late at night after a haircut and the food is decent. It has cha sao(bbq pork). I liked it and am willing to go back again.
   * 5 Spices House | $$
      * Have you ever play Angry Bird's lite? Well 5 spice in Cambridge is angry birds and this 5 spice is pretty much the same thing but as that 5 spice. I would go to the other one though.
   * Ruckus | $$
      * Surprisingly a ramen place. The price is a lil high for what you get. I don't plan on going there again. The taste was not WOW! enough for me to remember too much.
* Allston Based
   * Bonchon | $$
      * Best fried chicken in Boston. Definitely go here once in your life
   * Dumpling Kingdom | $ - $$

      * Beef bone soup. Good to warming up on a cold day but I do feel like it is a bit bland.
   * Tasty Pot | $$
      * Amazing food. I really like this place and I try to come as much as I can. It is basically hot pot that they precook and most of it is spicy. 
   * Coreanos $ - $$
      * Korean/Mexican fusion. It is a very interesting taste but pretty good nevertheless
   * Le's Vietnamese Cuisine | $$
      * Taste isn't much better than the other Pho restaurants. It is too far to be noted.
   * Gyu Kaku | $$ - $$$
      * Best thing about this place is the unlimited KBBQ. Eat as much as you can! There is alot of meat and the taste is amazing! If you like meat definitely go here.

Bonus Round(Bubble TeaPlaces)

* Kung Fu Tea
   * Down Mass Ave near Symphony,If you join ASA you get a discount
* Gong Cha
   * In chinatown, my favorite place in Boston
    * Update: there is also one in Cambridge Galleria
* Update: Abide
   * More expensive, unique flavored, kinda hipstery bubble tea store next to Darwins. 
* Chatime
   * It is good only if Gong Cha is closed since Gong Cha is just accross the street
* Teado
   * Cheap bubble tea, most clubs order from here for fundraisers
* Royal Tea
   * I think the price is a little bit higher than others. The taste is definitely unique. 

Also check out the bakeries in Chinatown! They are amazing, I love raisin bread and egg tart. Also Kalai has haircuts for $13 dollars. They do a great job at cutting hair although there always is a wait.

0.0,1587817626.0,0.0,mit,"So  I already made a post about this before, but felt like I needed the  input of others before I make a decision. I was admitted to Columbia,  Princeton, Yale, and MIT, and I am intending to study computer science  and economics. While this post is mainly meant for Yale and MIT, I am  still considering the others if you think one of them fits me more.

I'm  aware that these are both incredible institutions, so if you guys know  these universities, I would love it if you advised me mainly based on  fit, and the perceived culture on campus.

Here are a few things about me:

\-  I'm pretty academically well-rounded. I like math and science, but I  also LOVE the humanities. I enjoy writing essays where there is no wrong  answer as long as it's backed up.

\- My fascination with technology mainly comes from the things you can do with it (i.e. application)

\-  I feel that my main strengths are in speech and debate (did a lot of  MUN in HS). I am pretty politically engaged, and I would love to be in a  campus that is similar.

\-I am not  sure that computer science is my life's passion with ultimate  certainty, and later down the road I would much rather have an  executive/leadership role in a company than be a software engineer

\-  I am also a big fan of entrepreneurship, business, and economics, and  would love to take these as either a joint or secondary major. I am  interested in startups and would love to start one in college.

\-I am interested in a more collaborative atmosphere, rather than one that has toxic competition

\-I  am an extrovert- my favorite activities to do on a weekend are social. I  typically go out to town or party, but I am also interested in doing  similar social things on campus.

\-I  would personally prefer an urban environment like that of MIT or  Columbia rather than a suburban/smaller urban one like Yale or Princeton

\-  I'm also scared that the academic rigor of an institution like MIT will  make me hate my major more than an institution like Yale, especially  since I see myself much more as a founder/CEO with a tech background,  rather than a software engineer.

Also  as an aside, I still haven't received my financial aid package from  Yale. Do you guys think I should request an extension since I am  seriously considering it?",Help a super stressed out student decide- Yale vs MIT,t3_g7sp9u,0.0,0.5,ParfaitGlace

Everyone around me says I'm completely crazy for choosing UD, but I think I have my reasons, I just don't know how valid they are. Before getting into the details, I'll say money is not an issue, I have not been on either campus and I did not actually participate in CP\* at all (kind of regret it but I truly thought MIT wasn't right for me then).

So far I kind of have these arguments for MIT as my parents/friends/current students/third aunt idk tell me: 

* interesting people, will motivate me much more than those even in UD honors
* workload made easier by ""shared suffering"" and collaboration (my high school was kind of like this as a STEM boarding school so I can kind of understand how this can be good)
* resources, connections, prestige (yes everyone mentions this when they talk about me not choosing MIT I don't know how much this really matters, probably more than I think ?)

My gripes about MIT that prevented me from considering it much: 

* WORK - I was a complete nerd last yr in 11th grade and studied for an olympiad possibly avg 5 hrs/day. It was fulfilling in the end but I realized it's definitely not how I want to live life. I couldn't do any hobbies, meet new people, gym, meditate/read for fun/try new things/be happier/etc, and so this year I stopped doing as much schoolwork (took only blowoff classes). I care about chemistry a lot still, it's just I don't want to be stuck studying all the time when (and this is how I perceive it) I could be at UD doing the same thing while actually becoming a better person. I really value my free time now and I think MIT would just kill it so fast
* I have a pipe dream of becoming a high school chemistry teacher (if I ever become extremely patient/talkative/understanding with time) and MIT's prestige doesn't mean anything here (?)
* Also may have a little impostor syndrome lmao but I don't think this is really big

I guess I realized that if I can get in a relaxed schedule, MIT is fine, but I think people have deluded me into thinking ""your life is so easy if you take the bare minimum, everyone at MIT overloads themselves!"" So my questions are

1. For a single-major ChemE, how possible is an average schedule of 8-9 hrs sleep/day, 1-2 hrs hw, 2 hrs non-academic hobby, 1 hr reading for fun, 1 hr gym? I might be completely crazy - is this possible at UD or similar?

\-------------------

Hi, I'm a '24 choosing between the two schools in title. I am a super indecisive person and literally (literally!) have no idea which one I prefer. Thoughts?

If it helps -- I'm going in as a pure math major and likely pre-MD/PhD. If I go to Brown, I would likely double major in bio/math. I thrive on challenge and being with people who do, but I'm trying to balance that w/ pre-med requirements.

I'm quite social/extroverted and enjoy parties now and then, but I don't plan to drink much (and hope to be at a school where that's okay). I'm a pretty driven/focused person, and I like to be around people who are similar in that way (but collaborative more than competitive). I think ""social nerd"" describes me pretty well, though I'm not super nerdy.

MIT -- **Pros:** What drew me here is the fact that everyone is super driven and wants to make a difference, and research is great. I've made a bunch of friends already and feel like I would fit in very well with the community. I love the idea of having pset parties late into the night on whiteboards and talking about random cool math problems, even if they aren't related to class. **Cons:** I'm worried about the workload, sleep, and mental health, especially since I won't be able to place out of any classes there (my school is not very academic and doesn't offer APs). I also don't know how much time I'd have for extracurriculars.

Brown -- **Pros:** I love the open curriculum. There isn't grade deflation so pre-med might be easier. It also seems like it would be less stressful than MIT, and I could test into higher-level courses. The people seem quite humble and very friendly. **Cons:** I'm worried that I might not find ""my people"" in the same way/the community might not be as good of a fit. At my current HS, I've sometimes felt like it was hard to connect with classmates bc they had very different interests than me. I'm pretty clear this wouldn't be an issue at MIT, not convinced about Brown. I also don't know how strong the pure math program is/what research is like.

To the members of the MIT community,

The day before I was set to graduate from my Caracas high school, the city suffered a major earthquake. Buildings collapsed. There were serious casualties. Suddenly, it was impossible, physically and emotionally, to hold the traditional graduation ceremony we had all been counting on. 

I still remember the pain and disappointment – so I write with special sympathy and great regret to let you know that, in a world so disrupted by Covid-19, it is clear we cannot conduct our traditional in-person celebration of Commencement, Hooding and Tech Reunions in late May. 

To the Class of 2020 and all of our graduating students, to your proud families and faculty friends, and to our reunion-year alumni: I know you have been holding out hope that the recognition you have earned might still be presented in the usual way. We have all been hoping. So I expect this news may be sharply disappointing.

But I promise you, we are going to reinvent these wonderful rituals to honor and celebrate with you, in the best MIT spirit, in ways that make sense in this most unusual time.

Getting the details right will be important, and we know you will have questions; as plans develop, we will share updated information with everyone affected. (And if you already ordered regalia, you will receive a follow-up communication.) 

For now, here are the broad strokes:

To honor the incredible hard work and accomplishments of our graduating students, Commencement 2020 will occur in two parts: 

An online event on May 29 to confer degrees and to celebrate our graduates. Those who plan our usual Commencement will co-design this program with our elected student leaders and some faculty.
An in-person celebration, to be held at MIT at some point in the future. The students, faculty and staff on our Commencement Transition Committee – whom we charged to develop the programming for MIT Commencement in 2021 and beyond – will begin imagining the possibilities for this special Class of 2020 event, under the leadership of committee chair Professor Jim Poterba and bolstered by new student leaders. Proposing that graduates travel back to campus naturally raises questions around equity and financial burdens, so we will do our best to plan with these concerns in mind.
To our graduating students: If you have ideas for these events, please share them with us and your elected student leaders at CommencementIdeas@mit.edu.

Although 2020 Tech Reunions will not occur as they usually would, once we understand the larger circumstances more fully, we will explore ways to honor class milestones and bring the community together again. I am especially grateful to the many class leaders whose energetic outreach – over many years, and in distinctive ways in this challenging time – continues to keep classmates connected to each other and to the great global family of MIT.

If you were planning to attend Reunions, the MIT Alumni Association will be in touch soon to help you navigate these changes.

*   *   *

As the Covid-19 crisis unfolds, you will continue to hear from us – a lot. We are trying to learn what works best in terms of frequency and channels, and we hope to find the right path between “too much” and “not enough.” We will convey practical updates, and we will honor the human stories.

For now, I will simply say that what I most remember from that long-ago earthquake is the people around me – family, neighbors, teachers, friends – shaken to the core, but pulling together to help, with remarkable generosity, fortitude and kindness. 

Those memories echo exactly what I have seen at MIT through the upheaval of these past weeks: students, staff, postdocs and faculty adjusting rapidly to this disconcerting new reality and doing everything they can to help each other and contribute to the greater public good.

In this difficult situation, the people of MIT have already endured and accomplished a great deal. The weeks and months ahead may hold harder challenges. From what I have seen, I have every expectation that our community will meet those new challenges with the same patience, courage, selflessness and grace.

May you all stay safe and well.

- I don't have any practical knowledge of what jobs I would get after undergrad. My super idealistic dream would be to work in econ/policy research because from afar or from a completely naive standpoint I think I would enjoy it. But also, financial stability would not be a thing I would turn down. 
- I'm interested in 6/18 because of the problem-solvingy aspect of like 'solve so-and-so problem given certain constraints and tools'.

1. Which ASEs would you recommend a freshman to take?

2. If I take the ASE for a more advanced class, does it also qualify as testing out of the other easier classes? (e.g. if I ASE 18.03, do I still have to take 18.02)

and a follow-up: can you even take an ASE for a harder class without passing an easier class?

A call for help: 

Has anyone considered using a raspberry pi or other microcontroller to hack something like a CPAP machine or other pressurized air device (like SCUBA gear) to make a DIY ventilator? This could save a lot of lives. Our current supply is in the thousands, not enough by far. 

As a healthcare provider, the settings we adjust are: inspiration/expiration pressure, volume of air delivered, and ratio of inhale/exhale times. Some people require oxygen to be added. 
Patients who are incubated are sedated so they generally have no respiratory drive at all. 

BTW: CPAP is continuous positive airway pressure, which helps those who stop breathing during sleep and they have adjustments for pressure only. 

Please share this with other maker communities as we need to think outside the box.

I live in an older house right now (with a small-ish bedroom), and have a dust allergy that bothers me despite my best efforts to clean, go to an allergist, use an air filter, etc. I am confident it is tied to my living space (small room + old house) since my symptoms greatly improve when I travel elsewhere for a few days. 

I am considering living in grad housing for my first year at MIT and am curious about which dorms/room styles are most conducive to someone with a dust allergy? I'd rather avoid these symptoms for my whole first year - haha! My hunch is that a newer building with a more ""open"" space may help?

With the declaration of a state of emergency by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the doubling of Covid-19 cases in the Greater Boston area, the Institute is increasingly concerned for the safety of the community and is therefore taking extraordinary steps.

First, we are cancelling all classes tomorrow, Friday, March 13. This decision was made after consultation with Academic Council, the faculty officers, and MIT Medical.

We are also strongly advising all undergraduate students to accelerate their move out plans. MIT will reimburse travel change expenses and new reservation costs up to $500 for undergraduates who move up their departure to before Sunday, March 15 at midnight. Additional resources for an accelerated move out, including free pick up and storage of belongings, can be found here.

All students who have requested an exception from moving off-campus and have not yet received a determination will be contacted tomorrow with decision

MIT housing just sent out an email saying unregistered students have to vacate housing by Feb. 28 (friday). This is the only notice they’ve sent (to me, at least).

So I’m confused by this email—it says to go the registrar if you’re planning on being a fully registered student. Which I am, but the reason I’m not currently registered is due to a financial registration hold (which  my family and I have been trying to get cleared, but in the meantime I’ve been receiving grades for assignments/exams for 3 classes/36 units).

Would going to the registrar even help my case? I feel like the only thing that could help is going to SFS (since they placed the hold on my account), but SFS has not been helpful whatsoever in the past, so I don’t really think they’d be able to assist me.

I’m planning on setting up an appointment with housing services, but I’m afraid that won’t help either. I don’t know if I’ll be able to meet with them by the 28th and I don’t know if they’ll force me to leave even if I can’t meet with them by them. I don’t really know where i’m going to go on such short notice. I wish MIT would have sent this email out earlier—I’m not saying it’s not my fault for having a hold, but the deadline to remove myself and my belongings is in two days.

I guess I’m just looking for advice? I admit I don’t know how to navigate this situation, and I really don’t know what to if I do get kicked out of housing. If I do get kicked out, I would still want to attend classes (so that I can have grades for when I ultimately get the hold cleared), but that would likely mean being homeless.",housing/registration hold help,t3_fa3eno,15.0,0.95,throwaway1624518

Over the past year and a half I have been reading a lot about retiring early on the /r/fire subreddit and reading about real estate and stock investing. My goal is to retire by 32/33 (i.e. 10 years after I graduate), which, based off my research, is entirely possible with the typical engineering salaries and aggressive savings.

However, most of my friends in my friend group at MIT can't really comprehend why anyone would want to retire so early. Some even sort of judge me for it and lowkey call me lazy or selfish. I, on the other hand, can't really see why anyone *wouldn't* want to retire early. So we are in an impasse.

I sort of suspect it's just the nature of the type of people who apply and get accepted to MIT.  Most of my friends seem to really love what they do and want to help the world. Unfortunately, I never really found anything that has inspired me, or at least not enough to make me want to work 9-5+ for the next 40 years of my life. I feel sort of bad for not having found my ""passion"", but I also sort of feel like more people at any other school would understand me, and it's just a function of the fact that I'm at MIT that my friends look at me strangely when I tell them of my early retirement goals. 

Anyways, I'm reaching out here to see if there is anyone else in the MIT community with similar ambitions and/or experiences. I'd love to connect and/or hear your thoughts.

0) If I'm not sure if I'm qualified for an advertised UROP opportunity but I'm still interested in it, should I reach out and ask? Being unsure in this case is like having the prereq listed be proficiency in Python and me having worked with Python but not for a  formal project.  
1) What does ""demonstrable previous experience of intensive computational/empirical work"" mean as a prerequisite for an econ UROP?  Would having done data analysis for a year-long high school research project count?  
2) What would be useful previous experience to put in a resume for a UROP about writing a review of literature in social sciences? I've written a review of lit before but it was for a STEM research project, and I haven't done social science-related writing ever.

0.0,1574182350.0,26.0,mit,"Hi folks, alum here. When I was in the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program, they urged us to read the essay [A Message to Garcia](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/hubbard1899.pdf). The essay is mostly a late-1890s polemic against workers who would take a task and then spend their day at the pub. But the key takeaway for a younger me was:

&gt; You, reader, put this matter to a test: You are sitting now in your office—six clerks are within your call. Summon any one and make this request: “Please look in the encyclopedia and make a brief memorandum for me concerning the life of Corregio.”

&gt; Will the clerk quietly say, “Yes, sir,” and go do the task?

&gt; On your life, he will not. He will look at you out of a fishy eye, and ask one or more of the following questions:

&gt; 1) Who was he?

&gt; 2) Which encyclopedia?

&gt; 3) Where is the encyclopedia?

&gt; 4) Was I hired for that?

&gt; 5) Don’t you mean Bismarck?

&gt; 6) What’s the matter with Charlie doing it?

&gt; 7) Is he dead?

&gt; 8) Is there any hurry?

&gt; 9) Shan’t I bring you the book and let you look it up yourself? 

&gt; 10) What do you want to know for?

&gt; And I will lay you ten to one that after you have answered the questions, and explained how to find the information, and why you want it, the clerk will go off and get one of the other clerks to help him find Garcia.

At the time, I took this to heart alongside “Impossible is Nothing” and “Sleep is for the Weak”.

So when my first job asked me to write an API integration with UnionPay, what did I do about the fact that the API docs were in Chinese and so were the error messages? Did I raise a red flag about the schedule risk and get the docs professionally translated so my team could deliver the project and it's additional revenue? No, I stayed up late in the office with Google Translate. The project never shipped.

I was fired for poor performance before the year’s end.



My lessons:

 * Your role as an engineer is to isn’t to search through jungle and sugarcane alone. Your job is to muster the resources you need to see the job done. So yes, ask the other clerk.

 * Learn to [Ask Good Questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) which empower your colleagues to successfully help you.

 * Understand the “Why” behind a task, so you can exercise skilled judgment about what trade-offs to make. If writing a memo, know your audience, why they need to read it, and what you can omit from the source material.

 * Understand the urgency and impact of a task so you know what sort of resources are appropriate to spend. That includes allocating your own attention. (See also: the Eisenhower Matrix)

 * Proactively clear up misunderstandings. If you were just discussing German politics, don’t write a memo on Italian renaissance painters because you blindly followed a non-sequetur request. 

 * Know your team’s strengths and weaknesses. If a colleague Charlie would be stronger at writing about Italian art, then be clear on whether or not you should pitch-hit for him or have him review your work.

 * Get good food, exercise, and sleep because [your brain is made of meat](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html)

Now I read at the beginning of the book used in 18.700 (the book is Linear algebra done right, Sheldon Axler) something like ""this should be the second course you take on linear algebra"", so I guess it assumes previous knowledge.

So is it better to take 18.06 and then 18.700, or just skip 18.06. I would thank anyone who has taken these courses to help me on this. Thanks in advance!

Please feel free to share this survey with your peers! :) Thank you!! Details below:

The Coronavirus: Student Experiences (CSE) Study, an online survey study, is seeking college/university students in the U.S. to report how they are coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

You can find out more about the study here:

[http://fullerton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6WfcydK4WVUYmHP](http://fullerton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6WfcydK4WVUYmHP)

You are eligible for the study if you are: (a) At least 18 years old; (b) attending a college or university in the United States; and (c) available and willing to complete both baseline and follow-up surveys.

The study will ask you to complete:

* 1 Baseline survey (approximately 30-45 minutes), followed by
* 3 Follow-up surveys (approximately 15 minutes), which take place every two weeks.

These surveys will ask you about such topics as your stressors and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, mood and anxiety symptoms, health, and academics. Many participants say they enjoyed getting to reflect on their personal experiences by completing the surveys.

The study closes on **May 1, 2021.**

Overall, your total expected time commitment is about 1.5 hours.

**Compensation**

If you are *not* part of the CSU Fullerton Psychology Department Research Pool: For completing the baseline survey *and* all 3 follow-up surveys by May 1, 2021, **you will be entered into a drawing for one of eleven $30 Amazon gift certificates**.

* *Note:*  

   * **You must start the study no later than March 20, 2021** in order to be able to complete all four surveys in time.
   * As explained in the informed consent form, survey entries that are flagged as reflecting unusually poor effort will not count towards compensation.

By participating, you will make a BIG difference for scientists, educators, and society by contributing very important information that only you can provide. So, please log on to the study today and let us know how things are going for you during the COVID-19 pandemic.

0.0,1612377521.0,238.0,columbia,"Wed, Feb 3 — SEAS Students across campus let out a collective sigh of relief late last Tuesday as Ivy Elkins announced that, after nearly a decade of research, she had finally demystified the PhD. 

Chad, CC ’24, who hopes to work at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, or maybe Google one day, said that his unique aspirations make this news mostly irrelevant. “A what?” he asked, before opening gmail to update his spam filters. Chad currently has a B in Data Structures and could not be reached for further comment.

Speaking with reporters at a press conference on the condition of anonymity, Elkins noted that their work is far from over — “I’m looking at you, dissertation,” she exclaimed around halfway through, to audible moans. When asked about fringe topics, such as how students are supposed to graduate if they can’t even get off waitlists, and how the university plans to keep 5,000 individuals safe in the middle of a pandemic, Elkins explained that she was ""not at liberty to demystify those,"" and referred people back to Bollinger's latest word salad.

Speaking to our reporters later in the evening, Lucas, SEAS '23, explained that he was overjoyed at the news. ""Every time I would get those emails I would wonder, has the PhD been demystified yet? I was starting to get worried. This is f*king huge"". 

A second student, William Cortez, noted the very personal effect this has had on his life. ""I always thought I wanted to study theater, become an actor, and follow my dreams, but after the forty fifth 'Happening now!!!' follow-up email I decided to get a PhD in Combinatorial Differential Geometry.

I work a very stressful job that typically involves ten or twelve hr shifts. I have pursued alternative avenues of work, after that was suggested multiple times. 1. pushing a problem onto me.

I am going to go into specifics apart from that.

&amp;#x200B;

But when I started looking at classes last semester at GS, I saw this very strange thing.

Most classes are one or two hrs three or four times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that this is fine, I'll do the homework before everyone else.

But now I'm finding teachers expect us to be studying over the weekend. I know that's fair, but I believe it surfaces this reality that GS students are kind of jamf%$$ed into the schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to now each week write a letter explaining my circumstances, and I feel almost like a criminal having to explain myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been making me very depressed this semester, as I finished my assignment due on Thursday for UW on Tuesday, but I still have hw and a quiz for French on Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand why the onus is put on me to explain this, when their should be college-wide rhetoric that prefaces GS students and the challenges they face. I shouldn't be made to feel like an impostor by needing to ask for concessions at the outset.

&amp;#x200B;

The depression is getting worse as I care about my grades but I'm beginning to realize I am not in control. I do not have time to study sufficiently. I used to study biology notes at 3am on the train back in flashcards, but I am finding that harder to do. 

So come each successive Monday I will do bad on my quizzes as I will have had only a half a day to study, and my compositions will be late.

&amp;#x200B;

My teachers will continue to complain that my essays seem unpolished or rushed.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh well. It's time to start accepting the people that do well are the ones whose parents pay for their room and board, their clothing, their food, their tutors: these people will do better than me, and there is nothing in my power to go against that.

0.0,1611711212.0,9.0,columbia,"So I have posted about this a few times but I am honestly confused as to what I am missing. So I took a 1 credit dance class during the B block this past semester (mind you this is my third gym class I've taken so I didn't need it to graduate.) Unfortunately I dealt with serious medical issues that made it almost impossible for me to go. My professor was aware of this and said it was fine as long as I kept up with the dance recordings. My advisor was also aware and during this semester disabilities gave me extra accommodation in all my classes due to my medical issues. Long story short, my dance professor informed me after the dance class ended that there was a ""confusion"" with my attendance and that she could not pass me. I immediately spoke to my advisor who told me that due to circumstances the best thing to do is petition the committee for a late withdrawal. She even encouraged me to ask for a full refund. While petitioning the committee I submitted medical documentation from my Neurologist as well as Columbia Health services I also had email correspondences between my disability advisor as well as my professor where she okay'd me for missing class. 

Today I was notified that the committee denied me and I am a bit befuddled. I asked my advisor why and she said that it was because my narrative did not line up and she told me to submit medical documentation and emails between my professor and me. I did all of that a month ago, what else was I supposed to submit? 

I will be appealing the decision as well as speaking to OMBUDs. But, as an outsiders perspective why do you think they would deny me when I literally provided them with such a strong paper trail, medical documentation and emails from my professor? 

Do you think I could also try repetitioning the committee to change the point average? I know that I could have taken this class for 0 credits.

EDIT: As people have pointed out there has been a lot of lack of communication with this petition. For example when my advisor emailed me with my denial she said I needed to provide medical documentation. I politely informed her I already sent her a neurologist note, doctors note as well as disability accommodation. I also said Iwould be happy to provide more personal info (such as I am currently on anti seizure medication for my illness) even though it’s super personal. and she responded “oh sorry I forgot you sent it in”",Tell me what I am missing with my CAS petition denial.,t3_l5t4ph,9.0,0.92,veggidumpling

I recently just submitted my application to Columbia GS for an early action decision.

At this time I have been unsuccessful in obtaining my HS transcripts because the school I attended is currently under a cyber attack and has been since last Nov. Apparently, a hacker hacked into the system and locked all county schools out of their records. (I know this sounds insane but it's true) Multiple reps I spoke to while trying to get ahold of the records said it is impossible at this time and to continue to check back bi-weekly to see if anything changes. I've also read multiple reports that my transcripts could also be unrecoverable.

I have reached out to GS via email and phone but have only been successful via email. I've tried to explain this to a counselor but kinda got a bland response and said they need to have my transcripts or else they will push my application back..but like lady, I can't get it...unless I pay the ransom to the hacker (YES I KNOW THIS SOUNDS F#%\*NG CRAZY).... so I responded back trying to be more clear and have not heard back. I am super concerned that this will count against me.

As of now they only have my essay, recommendation letters, resume, photo, and extracurricular to go off. I did 1 semester at a state school like 7 years ago but I didn't send those transcripts since I hardly counted it was going to start over anyway. (I think I took maybe 2 classes) My SAT scores were waived.

Should I try to get ahold of those transcripts anyway since I can't get my high school ones?

I gave them my diploma as well..

I am also just insanely nervous anyway. I've never had good luck and even though I want to attend Columbia GS I'm so scared they won't accept me. Even though I think my essay was really good.

There was an article in the previous issue that was pretty lame, actually, along the lines of ""why can't we get along"" with the Red/Blue divide. I skimmed it, but thought I'd look at the letters it engendered. Okay, the usual... wouldn't it be nice if we could get along, we can't possible get along... that kind of thing.

Then I get to a quite long letter from the Right flank, from a certain Kenin Spivak, from my school and my year (CC77). He also got business and law degrees at the same time! Very impressive. Also, his address is Beverly Hills, and I rather doubt we're talking about the flats of Beverly Hills (i.e., the cheap part) or a Beverly Hills post office box. I expect we're talking about the Good Parts. 

I wondered if I ever met him. I was a Physics major and never had the most impressive work ethic, so I'm sure I never hung out with a driven, ambitious pre-law student. I doubt he was in the Columbia Players or Barnard Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, which was my social circle.

What struck me is his many references to anarchists; he says it 4 or 5 times. Anarchists who want to destroy the nuclear family. Anarchists who seek the violent overthrow of the government (ironic, now). Anarchists who oppose Democracy (also kind of ironic at this point). Anarchists who are appeased by the Democrats, so Democrats become terrorists-by-proxy, of course.

I'm looking around and thinking, Anarchists? Really? Where? Terrifying!

I see he also goes on about the threat of cancel culture, which ""...directly threaten(s) the safety and welfare of nearly every American."" I think he should really have a chat with Ross Douthat, a fellow (not to me, to Spivak) conservative, who wrote a really cogent editorial about cancel culture. I recommend it. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/opinion/cancel-culture-.html

Spivak sounds batty to me, and I really have to wonder about the specter of these unnamed anarchists. Like many, primarily on the Right, he seems to have created a Fantasy Enemy. This Enemy's existence is vital, because it allows Spivak to vote to, say, lower his own taxes and regulations on his business, but feel like he's voting to Save Civilization. Much more satisfying!

I'm planning to apply to Columbia, and I was just wondering whether it's possible to take a special concentration in Sustainable Development while also majoring in Economics? 

From my understanding, it seems that you have to major in something else if you are taking a special concentration. So can that major requirement be fulfilled by Econ?

However due to my illness Columbia Disabilities (ODS) gave me the accommodation of extensions on assignments in every class, however this accommodation did not go into effect until late in the semester. For this particular class I’m worried that the professors will judge my papers due to me getting them in so late. I know I turned in “A” papers but I’m worried my grade will reflect my tardiness instead of the quality of the work :(

The two primary arguments posed in the email are that the university has ""$974 million in cash on hand"" and ""over $7.267 billion"" in completely unrestricted net assets from donors.

First of all, the balance sheet category of ""Cash and cash equivalents"" does not mean ""cash on hand"". The $974 million is in cash and cash equivalents which simply means that the money is in short-term securities that can be liquidated into cash within 1 year. Although this category doesn't break down exactly what sort of securities they're invested in or how they're treating them, it hasn't even been a year since the pandemic really started. Yes, they could have liquidated most of it but I just want to be aware of the fact that the phrase, ""cash on hand"", is incorrect. 

Second, the $7.267 billion in unrestricted net assets from donors has about 50% of it already committed to the endowment by the board. I'm not sure when the board votes on this issue and they may have been able to stop some of it from going into the endowment with the pandemic in mind, but it might have also been too late for that. If that's the case, there is about $3.7bn left completely unrestricted. This is still a lot of money that could easily cover a 10% decrease in tuition. I just wanted to point out the specifics within this amount of money because I think the argument that all $7.267 billion of the assets are unrestricted is false.

Here's something I learnt throughout the process:

&amp;#x200B;

If you're giving up after the first no, that's far too early. 

I got rejected during Bain's resume screening last year so I emailed the recruiter to pitch myself for the role.

Here's how:

1. I found the recruiter's email on Bain's website.

2. I emailed her the following message:

\~

Hi \[recruiter name\],

I did not hear back yesterday but wanted to personally reach out anyway to express my interest in the San Francisco office. I believe I'd be a good fit because my extensive background in either technology or strategy roles. Most recently, I was a product strategy intern at Atrium, where I identified the biggest pains in the client experience, contributing to 80% of churn, and worked cross-functionally with teams to brainstorm strategic opportunities to tackle these pains.

If any vacancies open up on the 20th, I would love to be considered for a first round.

Thank you so much for your consideration,

Kareem

\~

It worked. She advanced me to the interview stage. [Proof](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6736754043122663424/) (photo with recruiter's response):

Bain didn't end up working out, but I used a similar technique with McKinsey and eventually landed a full-time offer.

Today I ask you your thoughts on an MBA from Columbia. 

To give background info, I’m a Sophomore at UMaine and I would love to go to Columbia University to do my masters degree in business management. I reached out to admissions and they gave me some answers, but nothing too crazy. I was wondering if anyone could fill me in on some details.

1.) Is the cost justified?

Given Columbia’s obvious academic accreditation,     does an MBA there justify the expense? Would I be better off getting a masters elsewhere? 

2.) Why Columbia?

I’ve read countless posts from the other Ivy’s, and some of them seem to have an obsession with either hating on or hating Harvard. Some “Columbi” stray away from this norm and say that Columbia is the most toxic Ivy, while others say it was their third or fifth choice. What made Columbia the place for you?

3.) Better Acceptance Rate for Masters?

I also asked this question of admissions and they weren’t able to fully answer my question, citing that they “can’t speak specifically for undergraduate admissions, as I believe the requirements for different from ours in the MBA program. The review process for the NBA program at Columbia business course is holistic.” Someone gave an over simplification and said that with undergrad, they were more particular, and with graduate, it’s more a matter of “give us money and we’ll take you.” I think they might’ve had a bias against Bollinger, though. So, does anyone know?

4.) Campus living for Masters?

Short and simple: what’s it like and what are some pros/cons?

5.) Is It Worth It?

Putting aside all the above points, this is what matters most to me: is it worth it? If you could do it all again, would you go to Columbia for your education or go somewhere else? Any regrets or opportunities that you faced that only Columbia could’ve given you? How has Columbia shaped you as a person and impacted your life?

**TL;DR: I got myself \~30+ interviews doing this and it takes an hour to set up (once your resume / background is pitched right).**

**Step 1:**

I use [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) Pro’s company search feature to get a list of companies I’m interested in and their relevant contact emails. I use the filter feature to filter for US based companies that fit the industry, company stage, etc. that I’m looking for.

**Step 2:**

I export the list from Crunchbase and input it into Hunter.io’s [bulk email verification](https://hunter.io/bulks/email-verifier?via=link) tool. This validates that all the emails are legitimate.

**Step 3:**

I then import the verified list into Hunter.io’s email [campaign sender](https://hunter.io/cold-email-campaigns?via=link) tool. This allows you to send semi-personalized emails to thousands of people at once.

**Step 4:**

I then write a cold email explaining who I am &amp; link my background.

**Step 5:**

I then run the email campaign. One of my email campaigns had a 24% response rate and led to \~30 interviews.

The email you write and how you tell your story determines your results! It’s the difference between no replies and a 24% response rate.

If you want to see this process explained with pictures (and see an example of an email reply I got) feel free to check that out this thread: [https://twitter.com/KareemAbukhadra/status/1328067835323625478](https://twitter.com/KareemAbukhadra/status/1328067835323625478)

I've had professors insist on things that are obviously factually wrong, the vast majority of content in most of my classes has been dinky group projects for which most people immediately abandon any sense of responsibility, and it seems like the main qualification for entry is reasonable comprehension of the English language and a willingness to shell out considerable amounts of money.

I applied to Columbia early decision this year because it was my dream school. Yesterday, I found out I got in! My family and I were so happy and excited, knowing that all my work had paid off.

Then, earlier this morning, I got an email from Columbia about our financial aid package. The school declared that I was not eligible for financial aid, meaning I had to pay around $80,000 my freshman year. I was so confused because my family is middle to upper middle class, meaning that we should get some form of financial aid. I was also ineligible for subsidized AND non subsidized loans from the government. This makes no sense! But I checked my FAFSA papers over and over and there is no mistake! I turned in all of the necessary paperwork to Columbia before the deadline. The Columbia price calculator and what FAFSA said I should be able to afford were from $10,000 to $25,000. 

I'm just so confused and scared now! I thought the hardest part was past me and that I could go to my dream school, but now I don't know what will happen! I already signed up for a virtual meeting, sent them an email, and appealed the decision, but the anticipation is killing me already. 

Do y'all think that this was a mistake by the financial aid office or with something I didn't turn in? Is this normal? Do you think I will be able to overturn the decision with an appeal? I just need help to understand what is going on.

I’m currently in a 3000 level English class that’s lecture style with discussion sections led by grad students. They also grade our papers and determine our grade. 

So my first paper didn’t go too well (I got a B). I knew that paper wasn’t my best so I buckled down for the second one and even called in my friend (who’s a great essay writer and constantly gets A’s on his essays) to give me feedback, and I got a B again. Now this was confusing to me because I know I’m not the best writer, but I also know that essay was much better than the previous one. I texted a girl who I met in that class and asked her if she was satisfied with her essay grades and she was in the same boat as me. We texted two other people from the class and apparently they are also having issues with her incredibly harsh grading on a 4 page limit paper.

So now I’m wondering how to go about addressing her grading. Should I meet with the lecture professor or should we come together and request a meeting with her? I did email her with my concerns about the essay grades and my grade in the class to which she replied that the grade is a average of all our papers plus participation and I am a active participant. The part that confused me was when she said, “the B+ range is already above average.” I didn’t know what to make of it, so here I am on Reddit instead.

It seems that I have to stop attending. So I can't focus on class.

I met with financial aide and my disability coordinators and it seems they want me to focus on continuing in restaurants.

I left out in my entry admission how much I dislike cooking, and the negative effects it has had on me.

I'll write the least offensive ones here: PTSD, sexual assault, anorexia, homelessness. 

I'm not good at math due to my learning disability. I know somethings. If you add all of those up what do you think you get?

Apparently I made a large mistake in pursuing an education in something not very practical. 

So now I'm being advised to focus more on a lifelong career in cooking. To meet with my career advisor to discuss this as an option.

I knew something was wrong as I was starting to feel almost happy. I felt like years and years of failure were adding up into something that could give a value to so much time I wasted trying to survive.

So I have autism, and I'm trans. I stopped focusing on that to focus on school.

 I hate any sort of masculinity a lot. I hate that culture of work the most so I try to keep quiet. School allowed me to speak, and of course I wasn't that good as I had never had that.

I am just realizing now that, as I can't take out more loans to continue, I will be hit with the loans I have. As it is I was deeply poor while living on my own. So I will be even worse for trying at all.

I have to find a full-time job that pays way above minimum which is standard, and then I have to work probably five days. Just to enable me to take out private loans. I have met a lot of successful people who never had to fight so hard to get loans when they went to school. Columbia doesn't have classes that really work with a five day work week.

I'm going to have to suffer for the rest of my life for trying at all. 

I just want people to be aware of this potential reality. I had been living in fear for so long, that I became unable to think about the future and the past without breaking down.

I would take everything day by day. And now I'm hit with the reality of that.

Dear members of the School of Engineering and Applied Science community:
 
I write to share with you that I have asked Dean Mary C. Boyce to serve as our next Provost and she has, happily for us, enthusiastically accepted.  The following message will be sent to the larger Columbia community shortly.  You, especially, will understand the many qualities that make Dean Boyce ideal for this position, including her deep commitment to SEAS and to Columbia.  The School of Engineering and Applied Science is a very special place, a testament to its faculty, staff, and students, and with many important and productive partnerships across the University.  It has been enriched by Mary’s deanship and the University will now benefit from her strong leadership in this new role.  I will share plans for a dean search in the new year.  In the meantime, please join me in congratulating Dean Boyce.

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I write today, with great happiness, to announce my appointment of Mary C. Boyce, presently Dean of The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, as the next Provost of the University. We are, indeed, fortunate to have someone with Dean Boyce’s combination of administrative capacity, academic accomplishment, and deep knowledge of Columbia to assume this role, which is always critical to the University’s future but is especially so at this remarkable moment. Mary will officially take over as Provost on July 1, 2021. Ira Katznelson, who has been both gracious and enormously effective as Interim Provost, during a time of challenges both unforeseeable and monumental, has generously agreed to continue on until July.

Mary’s service as Dean these past seven years has been exemplary. The School has thrived, buoyed by her celebration of intellectual creativity in all its forms, by her thoughtful expansion of the School’s academic programming, and by the recruitment of top scholars from around the world to the Engineering faculty. Propelled by a firm belief in the value of interdisciplinary work, Mary has led in establishing connections among Columbia Engineering and other parts of the University. Due to her determined efforts, we now have more faculty working together in areas such as Data Science, Nano Science, Sensing and Imaging, Sustainability, and Engineering in Medicine. Dean Boyce has brought Columbia Engineering’s expertise to the world, perhaps most notably by organizing Columbia faculty to help resolve an engineering bottleneck that was threatening the reconstruction of the L train subway tunnel with cost and time overruns. And Mary has made a special effort to advance the cross-disciplinary and creative opportunities available to undergraduate and graduate students through new spaces, new design and research programming, and new curricular and co-curricular offerings.

Mary has also been influential in her contributions to the University at large. She has been an important advisor on virtually every one of the many new initiatives we have set forth over the past several years. And her distinguished service on important search committees for key University appointments has broadened her knowledge of the institution and provided wise counsel when it was needed.

Dean Boyce is Columbia’s Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor of Engineering. When she arrived at Columbia in 2013 to lead the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Mary had been on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for 25 years, a period during which her research in the area of materials and mechanics led to innovative hybrid material design and earned broad respect across the field. Dean Boyce is a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Engineering. She earned her BS degree in Engineering Science and Mechanics from Virginia Tech, and her MS and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from MIT.

In short, Mary is an accomplished scholar, an effective leader, and a consummate University citizen. I am delighted she has agreed to serve as Provost and look forward to working even more closely with her in the years to come. I will write soon about a search for Mary’s successor and interim leadership at The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. But now, we celebrate our good luck in having Mary’s many talents dedicated to the advancement of Columbia.

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger

Email from Dean Boyce:

Dear Columbia Engineering Students,

Today, President Bollinger issued an official announcement of my appointment as the new Provost of the University, effective July 1, 2021. I am honored, humbled, and excited to be taking on this new role within Columbia.

It has been such an honor to serve as your dean. You know my passion for engineering and my passion for propelling students during such an important and pivotal time in your lives. Our student body is at the core of the greatness of Columbia Engineering and of Columbia University. Your enthusiasm, talent, and creativity have been an inspiration and a spur to do all I can to strengthen Columbia Engineering and further raise its level of impact. As you have heard me say many times, engineering is in a renaissance and now considered to be a foundational degree that empowers our students to succeed in whatever field they choose. Our vision to be Columbia Engineers for Humanity continues and I intend to play a role in helping to advance this vision from my new vantage point as Provost at Columbia.

As we near the end of one term and prepare for another, I want to thank you again for your resilience and spirit. You demonstrate time and again that despite our remoteness, we are part of one Columbia community.

President Bollinger’s announcement follows below.

Gratefully,

Mary C. Boyce

GRE is not required for this program, but would my application be strong enough on its own?

My background is as follows:

Political Science major, French minor from a decent state school in Texas, graduated December 2019. Completed Associate's at a local community college before transferring to my University on a full ride scholarship through a private scholarship foundation for select state schools.

LOR: 1 from my thesis advisor and former prof, 1 from previous internships and potentially from community college profs. Will also probably get one from my corps manager when my contract ends. 

GPA: 3.8; this is cumulative from total college career

Undergrad info:

•Active in honors and Phi Theta Kappa while at community college, held leadership roles and attended conferences for Phi Theta Kappa. Also volunteered as a debate coach for a local high school club.

•At University, did Model UN briefly, founded a human trafficking awareness student organization, wrote undergrad thesis with IRB approved research and presented at a conference. 

•Also did a semester abroad in France taking intensive French language courses 

Internships: 1 with local anti-trafficking organization, then at the George W Bush Presidential Center as a research and evaluation intern, spent about 7 months here. 

Currently, I am completing a service year through AmeriCorps in the NYC area. 

Would my application be strong enough without the GRE or should I still try and take it? Covid has rendered it somewhat useless, but would it make a difference for me?

I had a small question and I kind of looked through just about every relevant thread I could find but nothing very similar to my particular circumstance. 
To begin, I was a mediocre student in high school and basically barely passed and had to do extra work to get my diploma. I ended up also doing pretty poorly in school due to some personal issues and not being ready for being out on my own at school. I spent some time working and life kept happening so I put off going back to school until I landed a government job. I was able to go back to school and almost got all. As but did badly in one semester due to the pandemic and all the overtime I had to do, so my GPA is in the low 3s, before that it was a 4.0. I got a letter of recommendation from both my mentor and from the Vice President of the school since I made their honor roll once or twice. Am I a moderately strong candidate or should I apply after taking a few more classes? I think I summed up everything well in my essay, although I went over by a couple of hundred words but that was my 5th rework and draft, having already shaved off a thousand.

0.0,1612757370.0,20.0,stanford,"So I graduated from Yale a couple years ago, but when I was deciding on schools I was **really** torn between Yale and Stanford. I ended up choosing Yale on a whim, probably because it was closer to home and felt more familiar, but I pretty much regretted the decision immediately and it took me a couple years to get over it. I ended up liking Yale overall, but I never really felt at home there.

I just moved out to Northern California, and being here is bringing back all the feelings of regret in the first couple years of college. I'm realizing just how much I love the weather and vibe of California life. I feel like I would have really appreciated getting to spend so much time outdoors, getting to be in a less stuffy/cynical, more innovative/optimistic atmosphere, getting to be in a place that was different from where I grew up. I studied a mix of ecology and humanities, and am sure I would have had similar academic experiences at either school to some extent, but what I really feel like I missed out on was the weather, campus, community, and the vibe. I've visited a few times over the years, and always feel more at home on Stanford's campus and in California in general. At the same time, I did make lots of amazing friends at Yale, grew a ton as a person, and was overall, in the end, pretty happy with my experience—it's just that I keep comparing it to what I always imagined Stanford would have been like. I keep wondering who the friends are that I would have made, that I never met, and who I would have become if I'd gone there.

So I have 3 questions for Stanford alums/students:

1. Honestly, I know there are certain things I missed out on, but I just want to feel like I didn't totally screw up. Does anyone have advice for how to feel better about having not gone to Stanford for undergrad?
2. Recently I've been looking into Stanford for graduate programs, and have found some programs I think I would really love, and I think that could give me a chance to be in a place that has always seemed like it would be a great fit for me. But I am worried that grad student life doesn't have the sense of community or integration into campus life that undergrad would have had. What is community look like for grad students?
3.  I really love living in California, and think I want to stay out here long term! Any advice for a recent east coast transplant, without much of a network here?

3. How's the lighting? The photos make it look absolutely gorgeous, but these are daytime photos... It looks like the main source of light is a small fan at the ceiling? 
4. Not studio-specific, I suppose, but what is the sanitation like prior to move-in? I'm a bit paranoid especially during these times, and I saw stuff like a shower curtain in the bathroom photo. Are things like that wiped down?

Nevertheless, I’d like to start with 106B instead of A :P so for someone like me, if I use my time to catch up on CS content right now, is this plausible, and if so, how exactly should I go about doing so?

(I remember someone in this sub mentioning that taking Stanford’s online lectures for 106A and then practicing on Leetcode is probably sufficient, and that’s what I’ve been doing. But Stanford’s old online lectures for 106A are all Java, and I know 106A is in Python now, so is this still a good idea?)

(And yes I did create an entire alt to ask this question)

Edit: wow I really did not expect this many people to answer lol. I’m so grateful for everyone’s feedback! As of right now I’m leaning towards starting with 106A. I still plan on learning what I can before I begin college, and maybe maybe I’ll do 106B if I do feel great in fall, but everyone here has made it clear that it’s fine to start with 106A, and there’s no need for me to rush myself (especially in my first quarter where I’ll need time to adjust to college life presumably).

I’d really like to thank everyone for relieving a lot of pressure off my back and helping me gain a more levelheaded view of college courses:) I guess I’m still sorta in that high school mindset of trying to overload, but I feel a lot better now knowing there’s no need to try to sprint through classes (and probably fall miserably).

there is also the side factor that these units would have been in classes that all felt pretty meaningless/purposeless, which may have been why i felt so much less motivation than on campus. also, i am doing way more extracurriculars this year.

but i think it was more than a workload thing. even if i'd been committed to less stuff, i still wouldn't have wanted to do it. 

but objectively, for me, now is the best time to take hella units. i have no commute time to classes. my ""dining hall"" is steps away. accountability measures are lower than ever because of e-learning. professors are grading more leniently for the same reason. for some lectures, i can just log into zoom and then mute audio and go do homework for other classes.

so why does e-school feel like so much more awful than in-person school? does anyone else feel this way?

To say that I am disappointed by the lack of solidarity from the Stanford community, would be an understatement.

I implore you to think about our equal moral worth as human beings, and more than that, about our shared claim to the Stanford experience. Have we not all studied in Green Library, snuck onto the roof at MemChu, ate a delicious hot dog at Caspar dining? Does this mean nothing to you?

The vitriol and anger currently circulating will engender harrowing consequences for our institution and for the free market system. If left unchecked, I fear this company’s IPO may be blocked, and they could even face delinquency. Need I remind you of how Stanford has [fallen so drastically short](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ps2PNZh) in recent global metrics?

Although I'd appreciate any advice or comments, soliciting them isn't my intention.

I'm currently living on campus with my friends. I love them all; they're incredibly chill, full of energy and fun to be around. But as an international student, I feel out of place. There are so many references that go over my head, like the cartoons and TV shows they watched growing up, the music hits of middle school and vines that I've never been exposed to. It feels really hard to relate or contribute to conversations. Often, I feel like I have no opinions about things. My friends would debate which Miley Cyrus song is the best banger or which Disney channel actor/actress turned to be the hottest as they grew up. I've never really thought about those things, and don't understand the circumstances that would force one to, yet my friends seem to have immediate strong opinions about these things and have come up with lines of reasoning explaining their positions. Coupled with the fact that half the time I don't know what they're debating, it always feels like I'm just an observer in the friend group. I feel like they forget I exist, and by extension I feel like an outsider.

It doesn't help that I already have issues with active listening, vocabulary recall or expressing myself on the spot. English is not my first language, and I've only been conversing in it for a few years. This is also exacerbated by the fact that 18 years of living with a manipulative, hot-tempered mom has taught me to be agreeable and actively seek to please the people around me. I often just nod, smile or laugh, not knowing what for. These reflexes seem to be programmed in me. Whenever I try to overcome them, try to be true to myself, I'm hit with self-worth issues. Nothing about my life, at least to me, seems worth sharing. I don't have any funny anecdotes, while my friends always seem to have something funny that's happened to them recently. Adding to that, I hate my body, every bit of it. Although I know that my friends don't view my as ugly per se, they always throw around the word ""fat"" negatively. It makes me question if that connotation carries in the way the see me.

Perhaps the only time where I'm truly able to be ""me"", is when I'm drunk or high. So whenever I have the chance to, I always get really drunk, and try to get everyone around me to be drunk. It's the only time where I know I have an excuse if I say something that people would conventionally deem stupid or of no value to the conversation. Heck, my friends would just laugh because they're drunk. It's the only time where I can say the word ""like"" six times in the same sentence because I don't know what the English word for the specific thing I'm trying to describe is. People would think I'm just too drunk, that I'm not dumb. This has been very unhealthy because drinking alcohol or smoking weed seem to ruin my mood for the next few days.

So, even though I'm surrounded by people I love and admire, who I know I can count on, I feel alone. I don't know how I'd ever bring this up to them. Hell, saying this makes me question if they really see me as a friend or they just keep me around because I'm a ""generally nice person"". And the thing is, I know they're good people, but I also know that they wouldn't know how to respond or act if I ever told them this. I don't even know how to begin expressing myself, like would I call a ""friend group meeting"" and put myself under the spotlight? That just seems too dramatic. Even if I manage to do that, I know the moment I start to speak, my entire vocabulary will just disappear, my thoughts and feelings will no longer feel valid or worth listening to. I can't bear the feeling of making anyone feel even a little bit bad or sad. My whole life prior to Stanford was walking on egg shells trying not to trigger my mom, not to have her throw shit and break shit, not to hear her scream and stop talking to me for days on end.

All of these things, and many other things, compounded with school work and fucking PWR2 (that seems to incorporate even more work than a normal year would have) serves only to fuel sixty different voices in my head that I have no control over. I can't stop thinking. I can't stop hating myself, hating the circumstances that made me the way I am, hating every piece of my existence. Closing my eyes, and imagining my existence melt away is the only thing that brings me peace. I don't know what to do with myself. I've been trying so hard, but there's very little left in me. I'm depleted.

I'll be applying to the ICME masters program next year, and I am looking for advice on whether I should apply to the data science vs. computational finance track. I am a CS/Stats major with SWE internships, so my profile is much more suited for the data science track. However, I am seeking a masters because I want to transition into quant finance, so my top choice is comp. finance, but I have 0 prior internships in finance.

Some questions I have are:

1. Which track should I apply to, given that (i) my top choice is the finance track, (ii) I have no finance work experience, and (iii) my profile is much more relevant for data science?
2. Is it possible to switch tracks once you're in the program? If so, I am thinking it might be a good idea to apply to data science, but I've also heard there are far more applicants for DS than there are for finance, so I might have better chances applying to finance in this case.

I loved the quirky irreverence and the accomplished peers. But I can’t stand the pressure and lack of empathy just because you go to Stanford. It’s a horrible place to fail. I can't stop the bleeding. It's a fit for the best students. There is little room for anyone else. I may need to leave because of it but before I do - has any one found a way past this? It seems like a serious issue that we never talk about. Posted this on Cardinal Confessions but it’s not a place for serious discussion. I need some advice on what to do. Do I stay or should I find another place where I can heal?

I suffer from severe suicidal depression for almost all of my life and I tried to kill myself. I got hospitalized. It didn't help. I remember my roommate throwing feces at the wall and yelling how he needed to tell Obama to retrieve an ancient artifact in Africa to save the world. One inmate routinely stole the clothes of other inmates. He would run around wearing them screeching unholy sounds. Another inmate followed me around threatening to kill me. During my week there, I was awakened by deafening psychotic screaming at nothing and no one every morning. My psychiatrist thinks I suffer PTSD from that experience. I routinely wake up screaming in the middle of the night after having nightmares about being stuck there again. I also got kicked out of Stanford. I tried to seek help in my hometown. When I told a therapist about my attempted suicide, she felt sad. But when I told her I went to Stanford. She told me to perk up because my life wasn’t so bad because Stanford has a lot of opportunities. She told me people would be so impressed that I went to Stanford. I could get a job and find a spouse and that’d be the end of it. We also did this fun exercise where I listed all the reasons why I wanted to commit suicide. For each reason I listed, she would tell me that they were invalid. Every time I would veer into a reason, she would remind me I could get a spouse and a job. Not a great job or spouse but just anyone and any job. I returned to Stanford. When I told my psychiatrist in Palo Alto I was worried about my grades (bottom 5%), she told me I shouldn’t worry and that I (a low-income student of color) was being another entitled Stanford student for worrying about grades so much. She told me that the Stanford name was so prestigious and everyone would want to hire a person with a fancy Stanford degree. She told me that Stanford people will always get jobs. Instead of listening to me, she claimed I was being ridiculous. She accused me of only wanting to get good grades because I craved validation from my teachers to compensate for insecurity. She pushed this outrageous claim despite evidence to the contrary and the fact that I needed to worry about my grades because I was on the verge of failing out. I later went on academic probation because I couldn't get out of bed to take my finals. I had my first internship rescinded because I didn’t meet GPA requirements.  I told my TA I was having trouble turning in assignments and going to class because I couldn’t get out of bed and was still adjusting to the odd impacts of extremely potent medication. He said that it was all my fault for struggling in school and that I had made extremely poor decisions which would have very little impact on my life. He talked about how much harder his undergrad at Berkeley was. He went on and on about how Berkeley was superior because there was no hand-holding and I was a privileged Stanford undergrad who cries because I can’t get what I want. He told me that the only difference between Stanford and Berkeley is that Berkeley had actual bite and that I would be kicked out of Berkeley had I gone to Berkeley instead. He told me at Berkeley 30% of students fail each class. The strong survive as the numbers dwindle but everyone develops real respect for each other because vast numbers of people fail out of Berkeley. He told me that if I couldn’t take insults I should leave engineering because real engineers tell it like it is. He yelled at me saying I should have majored in something like the humanities where people are always handing out compliments and only say positive happy things.

The culture is always happy. No one talks about how they’re struggling. I find it hard to make friends once they know the shit I’ve been through. One person told me “We can’t be friends because you are mentally ill and don’t have your shit together”. I told someone I had attempted suicide. They told me they didn't want to be around me because they ""didn't want to get run over by the crazy train and you'll do nothing with your life."" I told my friend that I was having trouble getting out of bed and was suicidal. My friend told me that I just need to be more studious and everything will all be fine. I'll never forget my friend telling ""You just need to do the work. It's easy."" I told some people that I was thinking of killing myself and they brushed it off as me trying to seek attention. I remember making some ""friends""  early in an intro engineering class. We did great until the midterm when I struggled to grasp the material and function once my health deteriorated. I couldn't put on a mask at that point in the quarter and came to problem set sessions so exhausted I couldn't figure anything out. I wasn't copying answers or anything. I just stopping contributing to the group's formulation of solutions and was confused at everything. After that, they began to ghost me. I finally ran into one of them. They told me off explaining ""I thought you knew something because you were excited about the class. But it's apparent you know nothing. I have no use for you in my life."" It’s as if people just want to be friends so that can network for prestigious careers later on. Stanford is dying. It's increasingly becoming a pre-professional tech feeder school where the already privileged can network some more; grab a few big titles before launching into big soulless tech company #1. There's still a culture at Stanford full of excited, passionate,  and irreverent students who want to learn everything possible. I'll never forget taking shots and drunkenly arguing about moral relativity with a Rhodes Scholar. I'll never forget discussing quantum physics with a Hertz Fellow over a game of billards. I'll never forget the times I stayed up late discussing fun finance schemes. I'll never forget launching a balloon into orbit with my dorm just because we could. I hold these memories dear but they are becoming increasingly extinct as my life unravels. When I was doing well and had a future, I benefitted from the passionate students and drive to do something great. But when I need real friends to cry with - there’s no one. It’s as if this entire university is becoming a place for networking into flashy careers. Fake smiles and fake California valley girls abound.

This place is a go-go-go atmosphere for the best students. There is no room for anyone else. We have grade inflation and support but the mentality is very much “You have so much so people dictate that you should be not just doing well but really, really, really on top of the world.” Here's the thing about Stanford, you have so much so if you happen to fail then it's your fault. Even if it's because of things that were your not your fault or outside of your control, you're expected to overcome them no matter what because it's you know Stanford. I get no sympathy from my peers for my struggles. I was an engineering major. I struggled in it but pushed on believing that it was for me. I was in every office hours. Spent 20-30 hours on so many of my problem sets. When I told students and professors this, they told me to start earlier and that I was being lazy. Professors are resentful of our safety net. I once asked a question and the professor told me Stanford holds my hand a lot but this is ridiculous. This question is so stupid that 99% of real engineers would have googled it up before asking it. Professors and graduate students hate the shit out of undergraduates. They’re generally awful teachers because they’re human beings going through a brutal and inequitable system. My friend TA’ed for a professor and he told me that the professor would take photos of failed undergrad exams so he could laugh at it and feel better about himself when he was going through a hard time. There is no real development. You really have to do it on your own. Only the very prepared kids can take advantage of Stanford. The chemistry program at my large underresourced public high school was awful and didn't prepare me at all. I took a freshman chem introsem to learn without pressure. When the professor found out I didn't know what photolithography was - he was shocked and told me that I was a moron. He told me that ""we should get an x-ray to scan your head to see if you have a brain"". He would often interject into class periods about how he was shocked I didn't learn about chemistry. I would try to explain I came from an underresourced high school but he wouldn't have any of it. He kept on driving onto my chemistry ignorance to embarrass me and laugh at basic concepts that I didn't know. He would constantly cold call on me in order to expose my ignorance. Never in the entire quarter did he cold call anyone else. I asked him to stop embarrassing me in front of the entire class. He responded by yelling ""It's the truth!"". There’s a safety net and you’ll graduate but it just feels like I’m grinding and barely staying afloat but not really getting any mentorship. I saw all the wrong signs but failed to steer clear because suffering is social currency in engineering departments.  I stayed up 48 hours for one of my projects. I had a professor chew me out for showing up late to lab because I couldn’t get out of bed. I went on academic probation because I couldn’t get out of bed to take any of my finals. The staff aren't generally great. Before I got hospitalized, I went to see my summer housing director for support. I had noone to turn to since I couldn't get an appointment at CAPS. She had the empathy of a brick wall. She told me how great it is to be at Stanford and how privileged I am since I can get a cushy tech job at fancy big name companies like Facebook, Google, Palantir and so on. I never got that appointment at CAPS despite waiting a month for it and calling in everyday for it to plead my case. I had reached a boiling point and became hospitalized for attempting suicide. After I returned from my forced leave, I had to meet with a residence dean for months. I already had a therapist but she contacted me biweekly for meetings. She was just so patronizing. I felt like a misbehaving 3rd grader in the principal's office. She was checking up on me constantly to make sure I wasn't a liability for the school instead of being an actual resource. I had tried to kill myself and she told me that at least we're not in Afghanistan - we're at Stanford. I think she was trying to say we have more resources but it felt tone-deaf. I was constantly hearing ""at least it could be worse"" but it made me feel like my suffering didn't matter because there was always worse out in the real world. It's demoralizing to hear. How are you supposed to succeed in the real world if you can't make it in a cushy place like Stanford? Why live if life is going to get worse than failing at Stanford? I saw an academic advisor. I told her I was scared of failing out and that at any other school I would have failed out - basically what my TA told me. She laughed and reaffirmed that I would have failed out at any other school.

When I was okay, Stanford felt amazing but when I wasn’t okay (which is a lot of the time), Stanford felt god awful. I do believe Stanford is a great place and the best school in the world but it's not a place for struggling students or anyone who happens to stumble. Before I apply for additional quarters of financial aid, I wonder if I should because Stanford is such an awful place to fail. When I tell people I go to Stanford, people are impressed but people really assume that my life is set. This kills me. My life is not set.

I am a low-income student of color who grew up in the projects. My parents are refugees. I worked throughout all of high school to help our family stay afloat because my father became disabled and couldn’t work. I grew up thinking gunshots in the night are normal. I dressed so poorly - that I received donations in my backpack one day because concerned teachers were worried that I was going to become homeless.

We talk about how privileged Stanford kids are but it hurts because I don’t feel like a human deserving empathy because I have the Stanford name. To them, Stanford means that I am a privileged elite whose life is set. As if going to Stanford can undo the trauma of being a poor person of color in America. Once you go to Stanford, you'll never be an underdog ever again no matter how disadvantaged your background was coming in. I know people who had private K-12s and extremely wealthy parents growing up. Somehow I am the more privileged person in society's eyes because I went to Stanford and they went to state schools. I seriously wonder if I can pick myself back up again. Stanford was home for me but I'm starting to think it was worst possible place for me to attend. We talk about privilege but don’t talk about the serious detriments it has on healing and failure. I wonder if I should do it here or elsewhere. I don’t really don’t have much to look forward to in life. I don't think I'm meant to be happy. I have lost the rat race to pump as much dopamine as possible into a three pound slab of meat in your skull. I want to be as sentient as the stars and the stones. I just want the hurt to stop. I can't beat it. I am only living to die. I am irreparably damaged.

I'm seriously considering taking a gap year (GY) before I enter university. (My school has done an honorable but poor job at keeping the regular caliber of my schoolwork high, and I feel a tad intellectually/academically stunted. I've also been online for a whole year now and don't want to make it two.) I have tentative plans to work/intern for most of the 15 months between HS graduation and the start of my freshman year. I am also looking for some months-long scholarship/ work-and-travel programs that are fun and intellectually engaging (LMK if you know of any!).

I'm a little uneasy to take a gap year, admittedly. Given the current geopolitical climate, innumerable complications due to the Pandemic, and my corporate inexperience, I feel that I might have very limited options. Another thing is money— my parents, understandably, are not cool with paying for all of my expenses (like rent and food) especially if the job I'm working is lower-paying and I'm essentially losing money as well. I would prefer to go abroad, but the chances of doing so could dwindle in the coming months. 

So my questions are (assuming SU allows me to defer a year)—
1. To those who have taken GYs, did you do internships/scholarship programs? If so, where?
2. Where do you think I should continue my search for GY activities?
3. Is extracurricular enrichment at all the best route to go during a gap year?

### Deadline Sunday, Jan. 17 (11:59pm PST)

Are you passionate about **global development**? Do you want to learn more about global poverty and effective interventions? Apply to join One for the World’s Global Development Fellowship this winter to go in-depth into the topic of global development - we will focus on the key issues the world is facing right now in tackling global poverty. This fellowship will feature **1-on-1 mentorship, speaker events, career workshops, and mixers** to help you gain more perspectives towards this topic and meet other passionate, lovely humans. 

### What does this fellowship look like?

The fellowship will focus on a different aspect of global development each week. You will get assigned a group and a mentor to participate in weekly discussions. There will also be speaker events, career workshops, and mixers throughout the fellowship.

Topics in the fellowship include:

* **Moral agency** in global development - is it wrong not to help?
* **Economics** behind global development - how well do we understand the problem?
* **Global health and interventions** \- how can we minimize the harms of preventable diseases to the global poor?
* **Philanthropy and its effectiveness** \- what is the most effective way of helping the global poor? 
* **Human rights** \- how do first world countries and organizations like the UN affect the problem?

### Who are we?

One for the World @ Stanford is a student group dedicated to ending extreme poverty by revolutionizing charitable giving. Those in the U.S. and Stanford students especially are often the highest earners in the world, with a significant potential for outsized impact. By educating others about effective giving, we thus hope to improve the lives of people around the world.

We are a chapter of [One for the World](https://www.1fortheworld.org/), an international nonprofit organization dedicated to this same purpose. Since 2014, One for the World has motivated thousands of students to take a pledge to donate 1% of their income and has donated over $750,000 to effective charities.

The Viktor Zhdanov Fellowship gets its name from a Ukrainian virologist who was largely responsible for eradicating smallpox. He was the deputy minister of health for the Soviet Union and developed a visionary plan to eradicate the disease, which the WHO agreed to form a campaign around. 

**Questions?** 

Please reach out to [emma123@stanford.edu](mailto:emma123@stanford.edu) or [jchen23@stanford.edu](mailto:jchen23@stanford.edu) for any questions about the fellowship or One for the World @ Stanford.

I just finished my first quarter here at Stanford. I made a horrible decision during the last test of one of my classes, which ultimately resulted in the professor to write a letter of concern to the office of community standards, stating that I violated the Honor Code.

At this point, I am past the denial phase and I plan to accept the potential charges of my case.

My questions about how do I move on? I mean I know it is my first quarter here at Stanford and during my really emotionally devastating and stressful attempt to fight this process, I realized that my consequences were a lot less worse than I made them out to be and only felt more anxious about it because it seemed so bad.

I plan on retaking the class next quarter so my GPA is not complete trash. 

But I wanted to know if anyone understands how the process works beyond accepting the charges. 

I wanted to know what the possible consequences were. The judicial counselor has yet to file charges, but is it possible that the sanction agreement with them is negotiable if I don’t want to go to a panel, I mean if I chose the Early Resolution Option. My professor painted my actions and that of others involved as something that is worse than it actually is and I was wondering if the OFCS sees the standard  punishment as something that has to be done, or different for every individual case.

My actions involved indirectly mentioning a sequence used for a particular question of a test on a public platform and I was identified.

Long term, do you think that this sort of action is something that is relevant to Coterm applications. When I first signed the Honor Code earlier in the school year, I didn’t completely understand its nuances. If I do a complete 180, do you think it is something I have to disclose to certain departments. I am not interested in medical school or law school, both of whom require disclosing Honor Code violations, but do others ask about it. I mean, I do not think I’ll be suspended for a quarter and I don’t have to explain retaking an entry level class right?

Also is an Honor Code violation something that is required to disclose to research opportunities or internships, or Stanford study abroad programs. I am undecided and what stressed me out the most about this process was the fact that I closed these doors.

 Since English would be a BA. and CS would be a BS. would i be able to double major as I had hoped? Would that just become a BAS and then we’d be allowed to pursue both? Or how does that work? Would it not be allowed?

At Stanford, back when it was in-person, I was constantly speaking English, from smalltalk in lecture, to random late night philosophical discussions, to commiserating in office hours.

Since I'm at home in virtual school, I basically lost the ability to speak English. BTW, English is my most ""advanced"" language, and I live in the US. The issue is that I speak a different language at home on a day-to-day basis.

Sure, all the media I consume is in English and I text friends in English, but I rarely ever get the chance to speak it. Throughout the quarter, I only spoke English during group project meetings, and occasional group Zoom calls with friends. Which isn't too substantial, to be honest.

The last time I was constantly speaking English was back in September, during my summer job. Recently, I was in a 1-on-1 conversation with a friend (not a group setting, so I actually have to talk), and I realized my English skills have really atrophied since September. I know what I want to say, but the correct words just don't come to my mind. Has anybody experienced this? Any tips on how to cope?

My current method is to intentionally spend time everyday talking to myself about random topics in English, so I can improve bit by bit. But I am also looking for other ways.

Initially, I was going to continue with the 60 series. However, I would then need to take a regular quarter in the summer, since both Math 63CM and Physics 65 are only offered in the summer. Skipping ahead would also give more time for physics electives in the future.

If I take Physics 120 instead, I can take it during the spring, along with a Think course, CS 107, possibly mandarin, and whatever else looks interesting. Then, I could have my flex quarter in the summer, taking the math class and hopefully doing physics research.

I've taken AP Physics C in high school, both mechanics and E&amp;M, and have had exposure to some introductory quantum mechanics. I don't know vector calculus or differential equations super well, but I've learned a bit and feel that I can self-study the topics over break and during the course.

My physics professor doesn't recommend doing this, since you should have learned the math before going into this, as well as the PDE course pre/coreq (which I don't plan on taking because unit count, currently planning to take 18). She also says that the 60 series gives a strong foundation, but I feel that my foundation is already pretty solid physics-wise at least, and I feel up for the challenge of skipping ahead.

how is coverage and where do you go if you need treatment? 

For more serious stuff, which hospitals would you go to?

Is physical therapy covered and where is that provided?

What is the coverage outside of Boston / MA (say in NYC or CA), as well as internationally?

I'm a current freshman, and some of my friends went to OCS advising sessions and got extremely specific and helpful advice about getting internships. After I heard that I made appointment too, but I was really put off by mine. I asked for advice getting an internship in the field I'm interested in (industrial chemistry r&amp;d), but the advisor just said he really didn't know anything about it, that it was hard to get an internship in, and that he recommended I consider applying to consulting internships.

I was pretty disappointed that he had a lot more to say about consulting (which I'm not interested in) than what I am. He also said that I should get advice about this from the chemistry department, but my advisor in the chemistry department told me that I should talk to OCS because they're focused on academic chemistry!

I'm an incoming law student this fall and wanted to get a sanity check from all of u Cambridge veterans. I'm sorry for the vague and nooby nature of these questions, but I've never actually hunted for apartments or even dorms.

Seeing the rent rates in Cambridge coming from a mid-size Midwestern city is quite jarring; is $2000+ really a fair rate throughout Cambridge for a studio apartment? Is Harvard University Housing (HUH) a good route to go, or would I be better off looking at other private landlords? Or, even further, is my best bet just getting on-campus housing? Are there any Harvard-specific peculiarities in the housing process I should be aware of? If any of you are from the Midwest, what would you recommend for me to look out for in terms of particularly drastic changes in lifestyle/climate?

Also, while I'm here I figure I'll ask, even though no one possibly has an answer: what's you guys' ascertainment of the administration's attitude towards potentially returning to campus this fall? I go to a large state school that never really vacated campus except for the tail-end of spring 2020 (i.e. students are still living on campus and going to physical, albeit altered/hybrid classes), but I understand that Harvard's approach has been more cautious.

0.0,1612149139.0,16.0,harvard,"Hello all,

We would like to open up a discussion about Rule 2 of the sub. This is a checkup to make sure it reflects the needs and desires of this subreddit. This isn't in response to a particular event; this is just something we have come across several times and I figure it would be best to just let everyone discuss it and come to a consensus (if that's not too optimistic). 

As of this post, rule 2 is:

&gt; 2) No advertising or soliciting non-Harvard sponsored products, apps, surveys, or other materials.*
&gt; 
&gt; *: Special arrangements can be made to advertise officially recognized events and organizations directly related to Harvard subject to moderator approval. Contact the moderators directly to inquire.
&gt; 

This rule is meant to filter posts that advertise things.

The wording and conditions of Rule 2 have changed slightly over the years; for a while it was just ""No advertising or soliciting""; then we added ""of non-Harvard sponsored ...""; then we added the asterisk. The original intent of the rule was to filter out spammy posts advertising because of the subreddit's name and reputation. However, there are of course legitimate things to advertise so we had to figure out how to best draw the line, hence all the changes. 

---

As it stands, the current rule requires that any person or organization not officially recognized by the University seek moderator approval before advertising an event, service, opportunity, etc. There have been plenty of queries that we've denied, but there have been some that we have approved. The MO for our decision-making is: ""is this advertisement useful, relevant, and legitimate?"" For example, the [Jeopardy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/jo2g8j/the_jeopardy_national_college_championship/) post was useful, relevant, and legitimate. However, there are some advertisements that we don't think meet those criteria (e.g. a high school tutoring company seeking to hire Harvard student tutors). We believe something like that crosses the line into spam and/or reputation-seeking. 

Please chime in below with your thoughts on the current rule, and if there are any changes or tweaks you would like to see. For example, do you agree with the two instances I gave above?

I'm a prefrosh that has been reading about Harvard club sports and is really interested in joining one once COVID is over.  I had a few questions about them and would really appreciate any help.

I've noticed that club sports at some schools seem to be around the same level as high school varsity sports, with many even having their own coaching staff.  Is this what it's like for club sports at Harvard?

Also, I'm really interested in joining a club that will give the chance to travel around.  Do club sports travel to compete at other schools and/or participate in various tournaments?  I'm most interested in the men's club lacrosse, men's club soccer, and club squash teams, if that helps to give more info.

Sorry for any mistake, English is not my first language. I also edited the post because my question was not clear to many.  Apologies for that! 

I have been invited to a job interview (postdoctoral position) and while I prepare I  would like to know more about HR practices at the university. I am basically interested in knowing what guidelines do hiring committees follow to avoid biases, etc. 

To clarify, I ask this question because I am curious about the process and I have limited knowledge about the job market and practices  in the US. I do not mean in any way that the university discriminates any group etc. 

I had several interviews in Europe, and also participated in hiring committees. In my experience there is a lot of variation across countries and institutions hence my interest in understanding more the practices at HU.

I've been doing a lot of thinking for next semester's course load and wanted someone (i.e. upperclassmen) to give their input on how hard they think my imagined course loads would be:

5 course route:

\- LS50b (counts as two courses)

\- Spanish 50

\- Expos 20 (unsure of which one yet)

\- Either Psych 16 (Developmental Psychology) or Psych 2485 (Bad Genes, Bad Parents, Bad Behavior - criminality and psychopathy class)

6 course route: 

\- Same as above but I would take both Psych 16 and Psych 2485 instead of choosing between the two. 

For context, this past semester I took LS50a, Psych 18 (Abnormal Psychology), and Spanish 40. Initially, I wasn't planning on taking Psych 2485, but since it'll be Buckholtz's last semester at Harvard, I really wanted to take another class with them since they were a phenomenal professor in Psych 18 and they made psychopathy sound like a really cool topic to study. However, I also really want to do Psych 16 next semester and so I'm torn and don't really want to have to make a choice between the two (especially since my 4 year plan is looking super packed already and I don't want to delay Psych 16).

tl;dr: 5 course route (two pset classes, expos, spanish, one psych course) or 6 course route (two pset classes, expos, spanish, two psych courses)?

I was introduced to my ancestry this summer and I came to learn many interesting things, one of which being that there was a lineage of Harvard and Yale graduates. This was indeed a long time ago; the first of my ancestors to graduate Harvard was in 1693, followed by two of his sons in 1722 and 1725, and one graduating Yale in 1735. In addition, there was also a very close association between my family and the first overseer of Harvard that spans from the founding of the college in 1636. I came to discover this information through various published accounts of New England's history.

My ancestors later emigrated and founded a town in Canada sometime amidst the American Revolution. Growing up, no one in my family ever taught me about the storyline of our ancestry. I suspect that they, for the most part, had no knowledge of any of this. My family did and still does have traditions around being loyal Bruins and Red Sox fans, although for reasons they never quite knew why.

While I am not looking to be admitted into either of these schools, I was wondering what legacy implications there could be for my children in the future if they were to choose to pursue studies at either of these institutions. When one declares legacy, is there space to expand on such lineage or is it simply a yes/no box that's ticked? Is legacy only valid if it is related to the school that one's parent(s) attended?

Hoping to receive some perspective on this matter from the current Harvard community.

How on earth do I cope with the constant rejection at this school?

Clubs? Rejected.

Grants? Rejected. 

I put hours into my applications for things and I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m starting to get tired of working hard in school and other areas of my life when things keep turning out so shitty. It’s really hard when I’ve been at this school for over a year and everyone I know has at least found a place on campus but I just keep getting rejected. People are already talking about internships they have lined up for the spring or the summer and I really need the money from a spring internship or something, but I keep getting rejected from things. 

I’ve tried research assistantships but I get rejected from those too. After over a year at Harvard, I’m really fucking tired of the rejection and it genuinely feels like I was accepted as a big joke so that they could have someone that other students could compare themselves to when they were feeling down. 

I’ve tried CAMHS too and when they had me wait for over a month to be seen, that felt like another rejection. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m sort of spiraling and I feel like I need something to go right, even something small so I can feel like life is worth living again and that I haven’t damned myself to 4 yrs of misery at Harvard, but I can’t find that thing.

Was just wondering if anyone could provide insight into GSAS life (like maybe how you guys found it different from undergrad, socially and academically) or the MS CSE course (e.g. whether coursemates tend to be close to one another). The social aspect is a big thing for me since colleges in Oxford/Cambridge are pretty tight-knit and you end up making really great friends.

I'd also be keen to learn more about career prospects (particularly investment banking/consulting), as well as the prestige of the MS CSE program. I've heard that master's programs in the US are often seen as cash cows and that undergrads, rather than master's students, are mainly recruited for BB/EB IBD or MBB.

This is as opposed to continuing on as a 4th year undergrad at Oxbridge. Oxbridge undergrad is seen as the most prestigious thing you can do in Europe - for example, MBB in London almost exclusively recruit from Oxbridge undergrad - so from a practical standpoint, would it just make more sense to stay in the UK?

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person and any usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me.

I've had visitors get right up on me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

People who are not students are hanging around and getting way too close no matter where you are.

Yesterday, I saw a woman let her child **urinate** on the grass in the middle of the Old Yard. Where people (like me) sit and study.

In short - students have a reason to be here - you (random families, tourists, locals who consider Harvard a 'park') **do not**. Not during this semester, I mean.

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

I am not a Harvard student myself, but a few things here confused me, and I was wondering whether anyone here would have insight into *why* some survey results are... the way they are.

• The number of students with an income of 500K+ seemed to hang around 13-14% for the classes of 2017/18, 15% for 2019/20, and 17% for 2021/22 (the class of 2023 had a “prefer not to say” option. Is this just inflation, is this trend insignificant, or is the number of ultra-rich students slowly creeping up?


• In the classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019, the % Jewish was 9.5, 9.8, and 10.1 respectively. Since then, it has not exceeded 7.7, with a new low of 5.3 for the class of 2023 (2022 was 5.4%). Is this response bias, or are fewer Jews matriculating?

• In the classes of 2017 and 2018, 12.5 and 12.8% of students had received mental health counseling. This number has crept up through the high-teens, and is now at 25.3% for the class of 2023, up from 21.8% for the class of 2022. Is this because of greater access to therapy, admissions changes, or a general societal trend?

• Most “National Politics” questions were “culture war” related, with some being *extremely*  niche. Why are there questions on transgender individuals in the military and separation of families at the border, but not a *single* question on education, healthcare, or economics? These are generally considered (along with climate change) to be the most mainstream voter issues.

I also wanted to say, the class of 2023 looks *quite* impressive. The whole report is fascinating as well — I am extremely impressed.

0.0,1595626355.0,2.0,harvard,"Alright. Hello people of Harvard Reddit, I have a question regarding these two schools and would like to give a preface for my situation and see what are these two programs.

I'm not really thinking of applying to these schools, more so I am just looking for information that is vague and the program is so new.

Obviously the first thing you do when you decide what master's program is your target is google what schools actually offer the masters. Scrolling down a bit past the ads and the 6th university website listed for Biotech masters was Harvard Extension. I'm here because I clicked on it to see what's up since I clicked the other 5 universities before it.

The whole process of earning admission with classes is pretty strange to me, but it seems interesting. Except I only heard of Harvard Extension prior for being a school of Ivy Rejects (it's quite a foul name), so is this program even worth the time, effort, and money for a Harvard University degree: Master of Liberal Arts (ALM) in Extension Studies, field: Biotechnology. (Copy pasted from the website.)

Seemed strange so I did look into the school a little more out of curiosity to see if they offer another ms in biotech (curiosity because of the strangeness), short answer yes but you have to take it with the MBA. Why? I mean sure I probably wouldn't get in with my GPA but if someone who really just wants the MS from Harvard in Biotech, why is it combined?  I looked a little further and even if you get denied by the dual program you can still get into the MBA program only, but not the MS program only? This approach for the degrees in biotech from Harvard's graduate programs seems strange so I was hoping for some clarification since I can't find much on MS/MBA program (it started in 2019 and has 1 page of info...).

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

Removed | Not Removed
---|---
[Exhibit A](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bjbaqy/about_to_be_a_graduate_from_hes_with_extension/) | [Exhibit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/admddj/hes_what_time_are_grades_posted/) 
[Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5ji6qb/can_i_tell_my_friends_i_go_to_harvard_if_its_hes/) | [Exhibit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/aixskc/hes_alb_acronym_history/)
[Exhibit C](https://reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/4i9dj4/harvard_extension_schoolbad_rep/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi60_eju97qAhVJ5awKHUwKA1MQFjACegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jG4m3obD13F7ucQU3j9FV) | [Exhibit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/92d6t7/my_harvard_email_not_deleted_after_my_class_at/)

I hope the distinction is clear from these examples. If not, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain further. 

---

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

0.0,1595165869.0,55.0,harvard,"Two years ago. I applied early action, never expected to get in, but when I did, I then immediately accepted my offer - because it's Harvard. I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action. Maybe I'm desperate to not be completely miserable, but can someone give me a reason as to why Harvard is the right choice over these other schools?

Although the first rule is very clear, one third to one half of the posts in the sub are about admissions.

Seeing other subs that deal with similar problems, I have two proposals:

1. Get Automoderator to comment on posts with keywords such as ""admissions"", ""alumni"", ""waitlist"" ""transfer"". The comment can remind them the first rule. This way, they are likely to read the rule and remove the post if appropriate;                              or,
2. Require posts including these keywords  to go through moderator approval. As things stand now, mods have to go through them anyway because they get reported.

If you're like me you should have gotten an email from [harvard@electionservicescorp.com](mailto:harvard@electionservicescorp.com) today with your Your Election Validation Number to vote in the Harvard University's Board of Overseers and for Elected Directors of the Harvard Alumni Association (HAA). This is the highest democratically elected Alumni board at Harvard and they have been filled with HAA selected alumni for a long long long time. So a group called Harvard Forward is working to democratically elect 5 candidates to the Board of Overseers to move Harvard forward (get it?) on divesting from fossil fuels, committing more resources to climate-focused initiatives, including recent alumni into our governance, and giving a greater voice to students. 

One of the candidates (John Beatty) is a friend from my time at Harvard's Environmental Action Committee so I can attest that this group is filled with super-stars. 

**Harvard Forward Five for Overseers**: Margaret ""Midge"" Purce, Jayson Toweh, Lisa Bi Huang, John Beatty, Thea Sebastian

A little about Harvard Forward: 

 **We recognize that there are many things happening in the world right now that need your attention.** The coronavirus pandemic is ongoing, and the Black Lives Matter movement still needs our unfailing support and attention. Many Harvard affiliates have stepped up in the fight to create a more just society and to support those who are suffering. Now it is time for Harvard, as an institution, to follow in their footsteps and take up the mantle of moral leadership and decisive action.   


The Harvard Forward candidates aren't just running on a platform of climate action, responsible investing, and inclusive governance. **They're running to send a message that alumni demand better than the status quo**; that alumni are looking to Harvard to take a stance on the critical issues that are directly threatening the wellbeing and existence of current and future generations.  


**This means addressing not just climate change but also systemic racism**, and Harvard Forward is committed to making anti-racism a larger part of our platform. We're currently reaching out to those in the Harvard community who are leading anti-racism organizing to find out how we can best support their efforts, and we'll share our progress with you as it develops.   


**We know that a majority of** **Harvard** **alumni believe that** **Harvard** **can and must do better.** We simply need to get the word to them that this year's Board election is the opportunity to create a mandate for change.  

If we get these guys on the board - **this would make history** by having candidates elected and represented by the people, not by being nominated by HAA. Last year less than 12% of alumni voted - if you see this and vote and then share it, it makes a real difference.

Last August, in a lawsuit brought by fraternities and sororities to challenge the policy, Judge Gorton of the United States District Court in Boston denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the case. In essence, the court accepted the plaintiffs’ legal theory that the policy, although adopted to counteract discrimination based on sex, is itself an instance of discrimination based on sex. The court reasoned that the policy applies to men but not women who seek to join all-male social organizations and applies to women but not men who seek to join all-female social organizations, and that this constitutes sex discrimination under federal law. In reaching this view, Judge Gorton relied heavily on the reasoning in one of the appellate decisions (Zarda v. Altitude Express) that was affirmed by the Supreme Court. It now seems clear that Judge Gorton would ultimately grant judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor in the pending lawsuit and that Harvard would be legally barred from further enforcing the policy. 

In view of the Supreme Court’s decision, following Judge Gorton’s prior opinion in the lawsuit against Harvard, the Corporation consulted with the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Dean of Harvard College, and the University’s General Counsel last week. We together came to the view that, in the circumstances, the College will not be able to carry forward with the existing policy under the prevailing interpretation of federal law. As a result, following a vote of the Corporation on Friday to rescind its prior approval, the policy will no longer be enforced.",Sanctions against final clubs were just lifted,t3_hi98yi,12.0,0.77,KantianCant

Hi all, just heard about HGSE going online for this upcoming school year. I’ve been wanting to go back to school for awhile now and I think this online option will allow me the flexibility to finally do it. 

A few things I wanted to get advice on: 
- is an Ed.M worth it? For background, I went to a top 20 school and studied business and education. Hoping to maybe go into education consulting after this 
- how much can I expect to pay? They’re not reducing tuition fees, so I’m wondering about the typical fin aid given by Harvard and how much I will need to budget/take out in loans 
- what are some downsides to this program being online? Time will tell, but I’m interested in hearing if people think this format will decrease the value of the program? 
- planning to keep my FT job and also do the program FT. Big commitment, I know. Would appreciate any insight on this

5. Econ 50:

Great intro class that requires basically no knowledge of econ, or math, or coding, or much of anything useful, and since you are a humanities kid thats probably right up your alley. 

4. Math 21b 

Linear algebra, really? It doesn't get much easier than this. y = mx +b, come on, that's baby shit. This is just like learning what lines are, the only tricky part is now they call them vectors––big whoop. 

3. Applied Math 22a

coming in at just 8 hours of work per week according to the Q guide this is like linear algebra but, like, applied, sounds easy to me. The prof uses the word ""gentle"" in the course description, it doesn't get much easier than that. 

2. Math 23a

So this one is like the baby linear algebra mentioned earlier but now there is some ""real analysis"" tacked on. Oh boy, I go day to day looking at real things, now you want me to analyze them? Cake walk!

1.Math 55a 

""Studies in algebra and group theory""?  Your biggest challenge in this course will be trying to remember the basic algebra you learned in like 6th grade. The group theory portion? The perfect prep for blocking groups. 

Some people claim this is the hardest math class in the country, but thats mostly hype so people dont figure out how easy this class is.

Founded in Harvard earlier this year, [Students vs Pandemics](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/20/harvard-student-pandemic-group/) is an interdisciplinary group of grad and undergrad students building community and empowering students to make a positive impact on health and overall wellness during times of crisis. Our three primary goals are to improve transparency and communication, build community, and identify needs and innovate solutions. We share health education material, resources for students, and opportunities to serve our greater community through our[ resources spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTerz_XiSYghoEMn01biDnqqBM_pQIa3S8o-BhEKy-s/edit#gid=531738015) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studentsvspandemics/), write policy memos for state legislators, organize virtual COVID hackathons, address the digital disparity, and launch other initiatives. SvP gained over 100 volunteer members within a week of its launch and is now there are over 370 members from different chapters all over the country (more chapters oversea are being built!)

We are constantly looking for experts in all fields. As we know, we are in a huge public health crisis from COVID-19 and systemic racism; and interdisciplinary efforts are needed more than ever.

Using a throwaway account because I'm usually more of a lurker on reddit than a poster. 

Now that 6 grad schools are officially going online for the Fall international students have been advised to not move to the US until in-person classes restart.

I'm now trying to decide between deferring for a year when it's unlikely that I'll get a new job (for context my contract ran out and wasn't renewed because of covid) or starting online and hoping that I'll be able to move for the Spring semester (which obviously can't be guaranteed to be in person).

I'm an incoming freshman at Harvard, and have been doing research into whether any of my AP credit will be transferable. On the Advanced Standing portal of the Undergraduate website, there have been some changes listed to Harvard's system for the Class of 2024, namely that...

&gt;Admitted students who enter the College as freshmen in Fall 2020 (the Class of 2024), and all subsequent classes, will not be eligible to receive Harvard College degree credit for pre-matriculation credentials earned in secondary school. This means that Advanced Placement examinations, the International Baccalaureate diploma, and international credentials will no longer be recognized for Harvard College credit toward the degree beginning with the students who enter the College in Fall 2020. These examinations will continue to serve as valuable placement tools, and certain examinations may still fulfill the College’s language requirement.

Do you know if it's still required to send Harvard the scores for this year? I'm losing a little bit of motivation to still study these next few weeks now that the scores won't be accepted for credit. If a student were to fail his or her AP exams, would that be grounds to possibly rescind them? Is there a way to still cancel planned AP exams before taking them? Do you know if matriculating students are required to send AP exam scores or can you choose not to?

Sorry if there are obvious answers to these questions, and thanks so much for any feedback in advance!

With everything going on, I completely understand any guesses at this point are pure speculation. But, I suspect some of you are substantially more informed on this than me. I know Harvard accepted 30 more people this year (1980) to maybe account for any covid-19 related deferrals or offer refusals. My question is how much will those 30 more admitted students affect the usage of the waitlist this year. 

Last year, 65 people were accepted off the waitlist. Any chance that number will be higher this year. And if so, how much so? Something interesting to note is that school who historically haven't utilized waitlist at all like Princeton and Dartmouth started to pull from the waitlist before May 1. And, UPenn dean of admissions openly announced, a few days after ivy day, that he predicted they would heavily use the waitlist this year. Granted, these schools don't have the yield Harvard has historically had, but its still weird how they resorted to the waitlist that early when they haven't admitted anyone off it in years past.

Personally, I've wanted to maintain some type of connection, but life as an adult gets busy and complicated, and I often find that it gets bumped lower on the list of life's priorities.  I did alumni interviewing for some years, and found it rewarding to help out and to represent Harvard to applicants.  When I was back in the area, I reached out to a few student groups and did a few talks about the premed process.  I went to a few groups' meetings, but didn't keep that up.

Harvard PROs: 

- social atmosphere

- grade inflation/ higher avg gpa(i might want to go onto business school later on + Harvard likely has more connections)

- it’s harvard (world wide prestige — kind of a dream school for me)

Harvard cons: 

- their cs department isn’t on the same level as MIT

- maybe less opportunities for cs internships, since Harvard seems to be leaning more liberal arts

MIT PROS: 

-strong cs dept

- collaborative culture

MIT CONS: 

- too geeky/nerdy 

- difficult (lower avg gpa)

- maybe more competitive for CS internships since like 1/2 the people major in CS

Everyone's been thrown into the virtual learning realm quite suddenly which doesn't help given everything else happening. Too much to process. 

More Qs: are all the College classes just pre-recorded or is there a live Zoom component? I'm also curious, is there a difference in perspective amongst grad students, mid-career grads and college students?

I'm a grad student and absolutely love learning online. Most grad students have also spent time working and learning to delineate between work, school and leisure - a learned bevavior that quickly becomes important. One of the reasons it works from me, aside from my learning style, is the flexibility it affords my work. I've lived in three countries this last year, mostly for work, and am able to continue my classes uninterrupted. I especially appreciate the live Zoom classes and the interaction with other students. I don't think that'd make a world of a difference if it was in person (unless we're looking to make friends - but even then, I remain in touch with quite a few students post-semester.)

Initially, I thought it was going to be a breeze since I worked during undergrad and managed well; but, online learning requires a new type of discipline that took months to cultivate. (I saved my in class needs for learning languages but also transitioned those to online format once I left the country.) Making that transition isn't easy but can be rewarding.

\- are Harvard students generally very stressed out?

\- how are the sociology/history of science majors?

\- it might be my imposter syndrome kicking in haha but is it possible to have a high gpa at a place like Harvard? I'm looking to go into law school for health policy, so keeping a high gpa is important for me.

I recently got into Harvard and Yale. I can't go to any admit days because of the current global health situation. I would appreciate it if you could allow me to gain a better insight into your institution. (I'm from Dallas, TX if that makes any difference lol).

I intend to do bioengineering/biomedical engineering on a pre-med track and go to medical school after graduation. I want a school with good pre-med experience and generally good advising. I want to be heavily involved in research during undergrad, and I want to be able to form connections with my professors. I just want a campus with friendly faces, with a lot of clubs I can become involved in.

I'm also interested in film and art as hobbies and I have a wide array of interests I'd like to pursue in college. I love to write and that's also something I'd like to do (i.e. I'd like to perhaps get involved at a school publication). I want a school that would allow me to pursue these hobbies as well as allow me to build a solid pre-professional experience.

I really want to know what Harvard's environment is like. Do you feel it is as cutthroat and competitive as many say it is? If someone looks lost on campus, will someone typically approach them to help? Are people friendly? I would appreciate your honest opinions!

Harvard's history is marked with numerous occasions when crisis lead to momentous change for the University's constituent schools. The most notable of these events for the purpose of my post is how Radcliffe Women began attending lectures with men only when male attendance dropped during the Second World War. Now is such a moment for the Extension School. 

Once we have contained or survived the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus (and we will survive), all members of the Harvard community should note how much of a resource the Extension School is for the entire university. Not only has it be tacitly (and intently) preparing for widespread distance education for generations, it also provides the University with insight and a diversity of perspectives the University would not have otherwise. 

Furthermore, HES reaches some of the poorest, and most disadvantaged people affiliated with the University. Presidents Faust and Bacow have discussed how Harvard needs to use its ""greatness"" to do more ""good"". Well... HES has been at the forefront of this goal since 1909.

While most people in r/Harvard may demand for the ""In Extension Studies"" tag to be removed from diplomas, I suggest 3 other reforms that will integrate HES more with the broader Harvard community.

1) Open University Apartment Housing up to HES degree students, at least undergrads. Students in Columbia's undergraduate parallel to HES, the School of General Studies (GS), are allowed to enter the housing lottery for their version of University Apartment Housing.

2) Allow HES degree candidates to enroll directly for all FAS classes (prerequisites permitting). Again, Columbia already does this which results in more veterans, mothers, minorities, and professional artists in their classes.

3) Seek donations for (or just build with the \~$40B endowment) a ""House"" for extension programs. This house can rent out rooms to students visiting for on-campus weekends, or to full time students taking all their courses on-campus. It also would give the Extension School a more visible presence on campus, and a new permanent home for a revived Grossman Library. (As an urban planner, I think the Church St. parking lot would be a great place for an ""Extension House"".)

I hope some of you agree with this assessment. Harvard's response to the coronavirus opens a door for HES to ascend to a place within the University it already should hold. I encourage everyone to email the school, the University, and any professor they know to highlight the importance of the Extension School for the entire University. The coronavirus may linger, but it will become old news as quickly as it became a pandemic. Its legacy must be used to improve the University, and one way this can be accomplished is to support the Extension School, and its degree students as much as any other degree candidate.",A Pivotal Moment for the Extension School,t3_fhi4x4,26.0,0.91,montym

It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&amp;adults=1&amp;check_in=2020-04-22&amp;check_out=2020-04-30&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from.

As I am walking from to Sever I hear a guy behind me say ""help a veteran get something to eat."" I turn around and I see a middle aged black gentleman in a wheelchair. 

I pull the Cliff bar out of my pocket and I asked him, ""Hey man I just bought this, do you want it?"" 

He looks at the bar and asks, ""Is it gluten free?"" 

I start looking at the back of the package and say ""I dunno man, I don't think so."" 

He, casually replies, ""Don't worry about it then."" 

I can't stop thinking about this interaction, so much about it was so weird. If I was homeless and asking for food I would definitely say that I had celiac's or gluten sensitivity for turning the food down. He didn't, is no gluten a preference for him? Does he have a gluten allergy? Is he in cahoots with the ""homeless vegetarian"" woman in front of CVS? 

I fully acknowledge that this man is a human being and has the absolute right to turn down my food if he doesn't want it. That being said, it was really disarming to try and give food to this go and be told no. More so, the way he told me no was so condescending.

0.0,1581641533.0,35.0,harvard,"As I stood in the mirror last night and admitted to myself that I wanted to declare econ I mentally prepared myself for the onslaught that living my truth as a lover of economics would entail. 

I first want to say that declaring econ is not a choice, I didn't wake up one day and decide ""I want to pick the most popular concentration that offers some of the most lucrative job opportunities after graduation"",  I woke up one morning clutching a copy of Wealth of Nations and blabbering to my roommate about reverse causality. 

To some of you it may seem like I am equating the struggle of being an ec concentrator with that of LGBTQ Americans, and you would be right, that's exactly what I am doing (because this is satire). Some would say that the backlash ec conentators face is actually more nefarious than regular-ol homophobia; I think much of the hatred of econ is based in the view that it is twinged with pre-professionalism and that students in the field  have merely forgone Harvard's fantastic academic opportunities to study something that will get them a job at Goldman. Regardless of whether or not that is true, the notion that Harvard students should not focus on finding a job and making money post grad has undertones of a quiet privilege, deaf to students from economically insecure backgrounds who do not feel they have the luxury of entering the job market without classically marketable job skills, and inconsiderate of other colleges and universities that serve merely as engines of economic mobility and not academic playgrounds. 

This is not to say that every hist and lit concentrator is some trust fund baby and every econ concentrator is a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who wants to work in investment banking to support his or her family, far from it, this is merely to say we would be remiss if we did not examine the ways in which class, privilege, and economic security permeate our decisions to come to Harvard and how we decide to spend our time while we are here.

My current interest is in international affairs, and as of now I envision my career path as something in that field, whether it be working for the government or a think tank/NGO or something like that. 

Going in, I have a relatively firm belief that my primary concentration will be Government, but I’m undecided on whether or not I want my secondary field to be in East Asian Studies or German.  I feel somewhat compelled to worry about this now because I saw that I would have to be fluent in either language (Mandarin or German) in order to take advantage of study abroad in those areas, as well as taking advantage of internships/work abroad, so I’ll have to learn the language prior to junior year I think. If this is wrong, or if this is something y’all think my academic advisor or someone like that can help me with in time, please let me know. 

My justification for studying German is that I have a deep love of German culture and history, and the idea of studying abroad in any German speaking country appeals to me. Also, if at some point in my career I have to work abroad, I’d rather be living in Germany/Austria/Switzerland/some German speaking country rather than China. Also, Germany being arguably the most important country in Europe, I think it will have use. 

My justification for studying Mandarin is that I find Sino-American relations extremely interesting from the policy perspective, and I think that it’ll become the most important country America has relations with, so studying Mandarin will bear the most fruit. My current conception is that living in China if I must would not be that nice (at least compared to German-speaking nations), but please tell me if that conception is wrong. 

I’m kinda torn, so guidance would be appreciated.

However after using the app myself, I found that the frontend design is very unattractive and makes it really hard to schedule/enter availabilities on mobile.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people’s availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of college students to the platform and it has been working great so far. I think that it would definitely be a very useful tool for Harvard student orgs.

If any of you have any suggestions or features that you would like to see implemented. Please let me know!

&gt;On November 27, 2019, Harvard University denied tenure to an ethnic-studies professor specializing in Dominican identity. Students and faculty at Harvard and across the country sprung into protest mode. The failure to tenure Lorgia García Peña, they said, resulted from Harvard’s racism. NBC Nightly News, the *New York Times*, the *Boston Globe*, and other outlets covered the controversy from the same angle.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, García Peña had been catapulted into the academic firmament with a speed that most non-intersectional professors can only dream of. She has been showered with benefits. Thirty-one percent of Harvard’s tenure-track professors lost their tenure bids in the 2018‒19 academic year without alleging bias, since most of those failed contenders were white. Yet García Peña has gone through her academic career playing the victim, reflexively accusing those around her of white supremacy. In this, she is a perfect synecdoche for ethnic studies itself, which also stakes its identity on the conceit that it is in a nonstop battle for survival against the forces of racism and exclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;To the contrary, ethnic studies is ascendant. It is spreading rapidly throughout K‒12 schools; its ideology has already bled into the political realm. It’s worth reviewing García Peña’s career as an emblem of a fast-rising academic field whose worldview is taking over American culture.",Ethnic Studies 101: Playing the Victim.

0.0,1578965509.0,47.0,harvard,"Last semester was overall a really good one for me. I met so many great people, and I am grateful I was able to so quickly find a niche at the big bustling nerve-wracking world of Harvard.

A big part of that was thanks to the Harvard Crimson, which was far more welcoming and accepting than I could have hoped for. It's truly such a great organization. Its comp process was long and challenging, but my comp directors made the experience completely manageable, light-hearted, and fun. We got to publish multiple articles and benefitted from the experience and expertise of thoughtful, wise editors.

So the Crimson-ICE controversy absolutely broke my heart. On multiple occasions, it brought me to tears. I am a sensitive person, and I try my best to be a moral person. I'm quite left-wing, and strongly support abolish ICE, the decriminalization of immigration, and taking in as many refugees as possible.

And yet I can't escape a simple, clear conviction I have come to: The Crimson was in the right, Act on a Dream in the wrong.

Act on a Dream was absolutely unreasonable in their demands and thoughtless in their actions. The main purpose of a public protest is to demonstrate public support for a cause. The free press has an obligation to scrutinize and duly report on protests, which benefits just social movements by spreading their message and reach. Reaching out to a government agency for comment is never an endorsement of said agencies' actions, nor does it inherently put students in danger. If ICE wanted to prey on undocumented students at Harvard, they would do so regardless of if a comment is asked. ICE's non-comment on the article is demonstrative of their uncaring attitudes to the lives of this country's many brilliant and brave undocumented students. Therefore, the Crimson, without resorting to biased reporting, was able to demonstrate the strength and moral conviction of the Abolish ICE movement in Harvard's community.

Then, Act on a Dream threw that all away by attacking the Crimson for conducting a routine component of journalism. The boycott by various Harvard student groups only did three things: ensure that their efforts and movements would not be reported on with their voice accounted for, cause people both in and outside of the Harvard community to think less of these vital causes, and spread misinformation about the actions and the nature of the Crimson as an organization. I've talked to many students, all otherwise smart and lovely people, who had completely warped views of the situation. Some thought the Crimson literally gave ICE the names of undocumented students, or that we collaborated with them to undermine the protest. I heard people talking about vandalizing the Crimson's headquarters. When people don't trust the Crimson, they will have trouble gaining a full, nuanced perspective on complex campus issues.

Student activists have wasted so much time and effort attacking their fellow students, and allies in making Harvard a fair and just community. It makes me so upset the wasted potential this unnecessary conflict created.

I want us all to move on

So, as an anonymous internet person, I hope that we all can find peace and cooperation in the next semester. I hereby give full, unconditional forgiveness to the people who have slandered my peers, and caused the national press to ridicule the Harvard activist community. I love you all, and I know most of you are good people.

If you want to make a difference on campus, one of the best ways is to comp the Crimson this coming semester. We have a generous financial aid program and do not cut anyone during the comp. All are welcome. Love and mercy everyone.",Harvard Crimson,t3_eoe0uq,47.0,0.9,MongolianBotanist

I'm a Harvard Alum and would greatly appreciate some feedback for my startup which I believe is well positioned to be disruptive and offers a unique solution and design.

My background is in the luxury jewelry industry so you can imagine my excitement about purchasing Harvard branded jewelry to celebrate graduating from the OPM Executive program.

Sadly, I quickly discovered that none of the available designs appealed to me. Given my background, I saw a great opportunity to disrupt the traditional collegiate jewelry industry by breathing some fresh air into the designs and distribution models and i'm excited to say that **Harvard has officially given me the license and rights to use all Harvard insignias and logos.** I have the green-light and am ready to start laying down some foundation for this business!

This subreddit is the first group i've announced this business to and i'd really appreciate your feedback on designs and materials. Your feedback will allow me to go into the manufacturing phase with a better understanding of the designs that people like most.

I don’t want to be rude or call anyone out, but I’m afraid of Harvard’s social sphere. A fair share of posts in this subreddit are about how lonely and sad Harvard students feel, the lack of a dating life, and so on. This just kinda worries me a bit. I kinda hoped getting into Harvard was like this golden ticket and life would be all butterflies and rainbows after I started college. Obviously, this was super naive, but now it seems like it might even be the opposite. I already struggle with sadness and loneliness right now and I’d hate for college to amplify them. 

I’m already somewhat introverted. In high school, I finally made some solid friends, but it took until senior year for me to find them.  I’m afraid that finding friends at Harvard might take too long. I wish I thought of this earlier because by now it’s too late to apply to other schools, specifically MIT. MIT seems like it might be a better fit for me (I want to study comp sci and am pretty nerdy in liking engineering), but the all-nighter horror stories and my annoying mit tour guide scared me away from applying, which I now sincerely regret. MIT seems to have a ton of sciencey, nerdy people that I get along well with. So far all the Harvard people I met are super into social justice, liberal arts, and debating, which is fine and cool, but not really the kind of people I associate with.

Also, a minor point about the people, everyone seems to be way more accomplished than me by just looking at their Instagram pages. Imposter syndrome is already coming in hot :(

Finally, sports are a minor issue I have about Harvard. I was hoping to play my sport at Harvard, but even if I could play, the D1 level of athletics seems very hard core and I don’t know if I could handle it, if even afforded the opportunity. I am aware of club options, but I don’t know much about it. 

I should also state that I am still almost certainly coming to Harvard. I didn’t really apply to any school that I would choose over Harvard. I really just want to know how I can make sure the social life goes well for me. I realize that it might be early to start worrying about this since I haven’t even been at Harvard for one day, but I’d rather be prepared for the worst. Thanks

TLDR: I am going to Harvard in the fall, but I’m afraid that a sciencey introvert like me will have trouble making friends, dating, and not getting depressed. It might be early to worry about this, but I’d like to know about all I can in advance.

When I have memories about the semester, if I close my eyes and re-envision my state of mind when I had time to think— on those routine walks to/from the dhall, to class, wherever— with minimal exception, I could only ever recall feeling angry, sad, or just nothing. It was constant by around the second week of classes. Feeling nothing but either distinctly bad, or just nothing. Just flat. And that flat feeling wasn’t much better than bad, because it would devolve into bad at the drop of a hat. The same didn’t go for good; something cool could happen, and I could feel relaxed for once, but the bad ruminations and mean inner criticisms would crowd out those feelings so quickly that I look back and hardly remember the good times even happened. By the end of the semester I felt like I was slowly losing my spirit. Just fading into something vaguer and vaguer every day. I felt like who I was there was just some even worse, even less likable version of whatever confused sad thing I was before.

My approach to these feelings this semester was mostly to isolate myself when I got into a really negative spiral, which ended up being pretty often after the first few weeks. I would avoid developing my friendships, not because I didn’t want to have friends, but because despite my efforts to cheer up, it was honestly really, really difficult to not appear cold and dismissive and terse in conversation even though none of that had a single thing to do with the other person. It’s not that I turned into an absolute asshat during those moods, or was explicitly mean, and it’s certainly not that I never talked to people. I really did have a some normal, good days, some great meals where I felt just fine and slipped back into my sort of funny, chill self. It’s just that I didn’t do it enough, and now I’m worried the withdrawn brooding side is all some people might remember. I could have done so much better. I just gave up and withdrew into myself too many times in the dhall or in classes or meetings with my EC. I could have done so much better. Not that I even know how to manage it, but I could have tried harder. I’m really concerned about the long-term effects of that behavior on my future ability to make friends here, because I’m paranoid that people have an image of me as this angry loner. Maybe kind of irrational, maybe not. I’m just angry at myself I let that side come out so often. We’re all people, we all get angry. Come on verisad, you’re supposed to develop methods to control yourself when you’re an adult. I’ve done a shit job with that. I shouldn’t have let it get this out of hand.

I’m just really disgusted with myself. I feel like that’s the best way I could describe it sometimes. Like when I kind of step outside myself, and look inward, I kind of cringe, because ew, look at me. I’m not performing particularly well at school (and know a few of my peers did consistently better, plus were good wholesome people, so the ‘it’s only first semester’ stuff is not really a tenable excuse), I have no friends, my jokes aren’t really that funny, I’m kind of weird and tryhard and awkward. Any people I met in the dhall, at my main EC, that I SHOULD have pursued friendships with, I either only half did, or just didn’t, because I guess I couldn’t deal with the effort of following it up, or just couldn’t reign in my emotions. I’ve even gained fifteen pounds, so when I’m not degrading myself in my head for whatever reason, no worries, I could always just look at my body and be fucking disgusted all over again. I came home thinking maybe being away from Annenberg would help me at least begin shedding the weight, slowly, since we generally don’t keep excess food in the house . . . nope, no change. And too bad the iota of motivation I actually did have to go work out in the beginning of the semester, when I got myself to the gym a few times, has totally burnt out.

I know we all have a mean inner critical voice and this is it talking. But the thing is, I feel like when we tend to say things like ‘don’t listen to the critical inner voice, because it’s irrational,’ my problem with that is that I feel like mine is, actually, pretty ‘rational’. I really do seem to deserve some, if not most, of the self-criticism. My personality is lacking somewhere. Not to make this about logic or anything, but it’s the inference to the best explanation. Take the real-life evidence, I don’t have friends. I’m not getting hit up. Never dated anyone. I’m a lonely person. I am capable of being outgoing and somewhat funny, but somewhere along the way the motor just burns out and somehow I can’t make and keep friends. I’m not extremely desirable friend or partner material, and I am doing this to myself, and am not getting better at not doing it to myself. 

I know it can change. Anything can change. It could get better, sure. Then it could get worse again. I told myself that things would change for the better in high school, and senior year — forget it, after Dec. 13th I thought I was holding that golden ticket, finally on my way to feeling ‘normal’ and fulfilled and with my own crowd. I remember the fever of the holidays. I binged the housing day videos when they came out, memorized all the flags and mascots. I watched that Adams rap video one in awe, feeling all fuzzy, like I was in on this special inside joke now. Well surprise, reversal of fortune, now who even knows if I’ll have a blocking group. I’ll have less than a month to figure it out. I just wish I gave it a little more effort. I couldn’t just suck it up and get back on the horse. That’s what life is about, getting back on the horse. And I couldn’t do it, and I don't know how to get better at doing it. I wish I could sorry to any person I was ever unfairly dismissive toward. I just want them to know how sorry I am, and that it wasn't their fault. It's also absolutely awful to consider the possibility that I could have contributed to even more bad feelings in others when I acted like that, and just continued the cycle and made it worse for everyone and helped screw over the aggregate pleasure, even if just a little. If anyone our there ever had someone just act mad around you for no reason, I'm sorry on their behalf. Maybe it was me. You didn't deserve that.

If anyone else had similar feelings first semester and wants to share any insight, I would really appreciate it. I'm currently talking to someone at CAMHS, and having some sort of evaluation soon where I guess they determine whether I should get on meds. That's kind of worrisome in its own right because my parents' divorce is leaving my mom in a really awful financial situation, and getting outside treatment is costly and I don't even want to think about stressing her out more, but we'll see. If anyone found other ways of coping that helped in the first year, it would mean a lot. 

I’m sorry this was a dump. If it’s too rambling, I’m sorry, delete it, or I will. I know it’s like anything else we all see and hear about here, but I seriously have nowhere else to put down these feelings. I hope everyone on this sub has a great New Years. You all work so hard and deserve the best. Whoever you are, I seriously hope you could find some solace from whatever you’re going through right now. I’m sure we could all use that right now.

I am a student from Southern California who will be moving (with a car) to Cambridge in August 2020 to start a masters program at Harvard. Disclaimer: I have read all posts I could find on this topic, but all of them seem to discourage car ownership by Harvard students as opposed to providing actual practical advice.

So with that said, could any fellow crazy car owners please share their thoughts or point me in the right direction? I am particularly interested in the following:

* What is the average cost for an off-street parking spot in Cambridge? Any recommended companies/landlords?
* If I am staying for 1 year, will I likely get busted for having out of state plates? According to the MA laws I read, there is no grace period to register your vehicle once you are an MA resident. That is in theory, how is it in practice?
* Is it easy to obtain a student parking permit? Are the garages fairly secure? How hard is it to find a space, typically?

Please do not try to talk me out of bringing my car. I am set on doing so (have very valid reasons) and am willing to pay for an off-street parking spot if it comes to that. Thanks in advance for any advice!",Cars - License and Parking,t3_ehyf0l,9.0,0.85,shortingdownvotes

0.0,1576211433.0,34.0,harvard,"Hey guys, 

So, idk if this is the right spot for this, but here goes:

This is my first semester (I’m a first-year) and it’s been the most miserable few months of my life. Every day I’ve been here I’ve just been sad. I know I’m clinically depressed and all that stuff, but I’ve never been this bad to the point where–now that I’ve got to take finals–I just want to curl up and die somewhere. 


Socially, I had a group for a little bit but there was a bit of a falling out–it wasn’t really anyone’s fault, but it was enough for me to distance myself and so I lost any sense of social belonging earlier in the semester. In terms of clubs, it’s just been a steady stream of rejections. And in terms of academics, I push myself so damn hard and I still get really shitty grades and I’m probably going to just end up with all Cs and maybe a B if I’m lucky. I just feel really inadequate all the time and everyone is always talking about grade inflation and complains about their A- or whatever, meanwhile I’m literally at the bottom of all my classes and I kind of just want to die because of it. I did go to a kind of shitty public school where I didn’t have to try very hard in general, but I’ve always pushed myself and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to fix anything in any aspect of my life and it’s been so incredibly frustrating. My finals have all been ass, even though I’ve given up what little time I made for myself to throw myself 100% into preparing for them. 

I tried to convince myself that, at the very least I could do something fun or cool over the summer because Harvard’s name–no matter how much I hate this place and no matter how miserable I’ve been–is powerful enough to open doors. I realize now how misguided that was, because I’m on-track to go home and be depressed for 3 months over summer break and nothing else. Maybe pick up an odd job or two but nothing relevant to my goals. 

I don’t know who to go to for support. CAMHS gave me the option of antidepressants or weird fucking support groups, that I know wouldn’t help me. My parents think that Harvard is the best place on earth and that I’m silly to be so sad while I’m here. I don’t have friends really. I’m just so at my wit’s end. I know it’s only one semester and I’m probably just a whiny idiot for complaining this much, but I really can’t see any way out of this mess. I don’t know if I should consider transferring, and even if I did, I don’t know what school would take my shitty GPA and useless/non-existent extracurriculars. A part of me thought that maybe this was something to discuss with PAFs or my advisor, but it seems like PAFs are just there to cart in food for study breaks and advisors to lift the hold on your account. 

And, even if I do stay at this school, I don’t see how things would be different next semester or the one after that or the one after that. It’s clear that I’m not academically capable enough for this school and there doesn’t seem to be a way for me to fix that. I’m just over everything kind of at this point. Life, Harvard,  everything else. 

I’m on mobile and I have fat fucking fingers so I apologize for any grammatical errors. 

I’d appreciate any advice or something. I don’t know. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I just feel like I need to scream myself hoarse but this the next best thing, I guess.",Shitty Semester?,t3_e9z4g6,34.0,0.91,depressedatharvard

For each of the last two years, we've had over 2,000 customers come to El Jefe's on this day and have raised over $27,000 each year. In addition, thousands more donated to the Benson M. Abercrombie ’21 Fund, established by the Harvard Varsity Club. Ben was a freshman at Harvard in Sept 2017 and was a defensive back for the Harvard Crimson Football Team. During Harvard's first game of the 2017 season, Ben suffered a catastrophic cervical neck injury and was paralyzed. What started as a beautiful fall day ended in tragedy for Ben and his family.

&gt;* Facing a lifelong struggle, Ben has worked incredibly hard over the last two years to build his life anew. Remarkably, in August less than two years after his injury, Ben came back to Harvard University and started his freshman year again. Let's let Ben and his family know that the Harvard Square and the Harvard University community continue to support his valiant efforts. Let’s make this 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Day even bigger and better than the first two! There are several ways to help:

I either find that people don't know what the Extension School is, and they think my degree is more prestigious than it is (which is embarrassing to then have to explain to them that no, don't get the impression that I'm anywhere near the level of a Harvard College graduate), or they have some misconception about the ES. Whenever anyone misinterprets my degree as being more prestigious than it is, even after I explain to them that I went to the Extension School and not the college, I feel like an absolute fraud. 

I guess I wish I had gone to school somewhere where if someone asked where I went, I could just say the university's name and have that be the end of it, not have to qualify my standing there. Like if I'd gone to night school at say, [X] State University, I feel like if someone asked where I went to school I could just say ""[X] State"" and that'd be all I'd have to say.

0.0,1569110474.0,45.0,harvard,"Here’s the abstract:

&gt;	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no one’s surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

&gt;	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn’t really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

I was recently looking into Harvard University's Extension School and after chatting with one of the school's academic advisors, I still came away with a few questions that perhaps some of you may have the answers to. I suppose the easiest way to do this is to bullet-point them, so here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

* For the ""Earn-Your-Way-In"" admissions, I was thinking of taking the three suggested courses that are on the Extension School's website (EXPO 15, EXPO 25, and MATH E-3). The advisor I spoke to mentioned that they would count towards the degree itself. Any thoughts on this? How were the courses themselves?
* I noticed that there's an on-campus requirement. How was this for folks? Was it a pain trying to find parking/getting a parking pass from the university? (I live about an hour north of Cambridge in Maine)
* How were the online classes/courses? I'm no stranger to online learning, but I do know that every school has their own ""spin"" when it comes to online education.
* How's financial aid for the Extension School? I noticed that it was mentioned online, and briefly said by the advisor I spoke with, but is it generous (if needed, I would only be taking sixty-four credits for the degree, as I will have sixty-four credits transferring into the program itself; also, I currently have a 3.67 GPA, if that goes into academic scholarship decision-making).
* And lastly, for those of whom who have graduated from this program, is it worth it? I've read other comment sections/blogs/posts where some have had difficulties with their degrees, due to the phrasing of the degree itself (""Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies,"" even though they majored/concentrated in Environmental Studies), and was just wondering if there was any sort of ""stigma"" attached to the degree, or if the majority of what I read was just a bunch of hot air.
