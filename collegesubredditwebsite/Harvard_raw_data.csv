I've recently been admitted to the SM in Computational Science and Engineering, and I'm very excited about it. However, I am struggling to find a certain number of informations about the program itself on internet. 

Thus, I was wondering whether a current (or ex, naturally) student would be willing to briefly talk about his/her experience in the program (or eventually just be available to answer a few questions about the SM in private, that would be great as well). It doesn't even have to be a student, just someone that kind of knows the program.

I'm an incoming law student this fall and wanted to get a sanity check from all of u Cambridge veterans. I'm sorry for the vague and nooby nature of these questions, but I've never actually hunted for apartments or even dorms.

Seeing the rent rates in Cambridge coming from a mid-size Midwestern city is quite jarring; is $2000+ really a fair rate throughout Cambridge for a studio apartment? Is Harvard University Housing (HUH) a good route to go, or would I be better off looking at other private landlords? Or, even further, is my best bet just getting on-campus housing? Are there any Harvard-specific peculiarities in the housing process I should be aware of? If any of you are from the Midwest, what would you recommend for me to look out for in terms of particularly drastic changes in lifestyle/climate?

Also, while I'm here I figure I'll ask, even though no one possibly has an answer: what's you guys' ascertainment of the administration's attitude towards potentially returning to campus this fall? I go to a large state school that never really vacated campus except for the tail-end of spring 2020 (i.e. students are still living on campus and going to physical, albeit altered/hybrid classes), but I understand that Harvard's approach has been more cautious.

0.0,1612149139.0,16.0,harvard,"Hello all,

We would like to open up a discussion about Rule 2 of the sub. This is a checkup to make sure it reflects the needs and desires of this subreddit. This isn't in response to a particular event; this is just something we have come across several times and I figure it would be best to just let everyone discuss it and come to a consensus (if that's not too optimistic). 

As of this post, rule 2 is:

&gt; 2) No advertising or soliciting non-Harvard sponsored products, apps, surveys, or other materials.*
&gt; 
&gt; *: Special arrangements can be made to advertise officially recognized events and organizations directly related to Harvard subject to moderator approval. Contact the moderators directly to inquire.
&gt; 

This rule is meant to filter posts that advertise things.

The wording and conditions of Rule 2 have changed slightly over the years; for a while it was just ""No advertising or soliciting""; then we added ""of non-Harvard sponsored ...""; then we added the asterisk. The original intent of the rule was to filter out spammy posts advertising because of the subreddit's name and reputation. However, there are of course legitimate things to advertise so we had to figure out how to best draw the line, hence all the changes. 

---

As it stands, the current rule requires that any person or organization not officially recognized by the University seek moderator approval before advertising an event, service, opportunity, etc. There have been plenty of queries that we've denied, but there have been some that we have approved. The MO for our decision-making is: ""is this advertisement useful, relevant, and legitimate?"" For example, the [Jeopardy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/jo2g8j/the_jeopardy_national_college_championship/) post was useful, relevant, and legitimate. However, there are some advertisements that we don't think meet those criteria (e.g. a high school tutoring company seeking to hire Harvard student tutors). We believe something like that crosses the line into spam and/or reputation-seeking. 

Please chime in below with your thoughts on the current rule, and if there are any changes or tweaks you would like to see. For example, do you agree with the two instances I gave above?

Sorry for any mistake, English is not my first language. I also edited the post because my question was not clear to many.  Apologies for that! 

I have been invited to a job interview (postdoctoral position) and while I prepare I  would like to know more about HR practices at the university. I am basically interested in knowing what guidelines do hiring committees follow to avoid biases, etc. 

To clarify, I ask this question because I am curious about the process and I have limited knowledge about the job market and practices  in the US. I do not mean in any way that the university discriminates any group etc. 

I had several interviews in Europe, and also participated in hiring committees. In my experience there is a lot of variation across countries and institutions hence my interest in understanding more the practices at HU.

I've been doing a lot of thinking for next semester's course load and wanted someone (i.e. upperclassmen) to give their input on how hard they think my imagined course loads would be:

5 course route:

\- LS50b (counts as two courses)

\- Spanish 50

\- Expos 20 (unsure of which one yet)

\- Either Psych 16 (Developmental Psychology) or Psych 2485 (Bad Genes, Bad Parents, Bad Behavior - criminality and psychopathy class)

6 course route: 

\- Same as above but I would take both Psych 16 and Psych 2485 instead of choosing between the two. 

For context, this past semester I took LS50a, Psych 18 (Abnormal Psychology), and Spanish 40. Initially, I wasn't planning on taking Psych 2485, but since it'll be Buckholtz's last semester at Harvard, I really wanted to take another class with them since they were a phenomenal professor in Psych 18 and they made psychopathy sound like a really cool topic to study. However, I also really want to do Psych 16 next semester and so I'm torn and don't really want to have to make a choice between the two (especially since my 4 year plan is looking super packed already and I don't want to delay Psych 16).

Harvard has only done lip service to the idea of being inclusive to students in different time zones, especially considering how many students from California, Washington, Oregon, and Nevada attend Harvard.

0.0,1604950570.0,18.0,harvard,"Hi Harvard folk,

I was introduced to my ancestry this summer and I came to learn many interesting things, one of which being that there was a lineage of Harvard and Yale graduates. This was indeed a long time ago; the first of my ancestors to graduate Harvard was in 1693, followed by two of his sons in 1722 and 1725, and one graduating Yale in 1735. In addition, there was also a very close association between my family and the first overseer of Harvard that spans from the founding of the college in 1636. I came to discover this information through various published accounts of New England's history.

My ancestors later emigrated and founded a town in Canada sometime amidst the American Revolution. Growing up, no one in my family ever taught me about the storyline of our ancestry. I suspect that they, for the most part, had no knowledge of any of this. My family did and still does have traditions around being loyal Bruins and Red Sox fans, although for reasons they never quite knew why.

While I am not looking to be admitted into either of these schools, I was wondering what legacy implications there could be for my children in the future if they were to choose to pursue studies at either of these institutions. When one declares legacy, is there space to expand on such lineage or is it simply a yes/no box that's ticked? Is legacy only valid if it is related to the school that one's parent(s) attended?

Hoping to receive some perspective on this matter from the current Harvard community.

How on earth do I cope with the constant rejection at this school?

Clubs? Rejected. 
Volunteer programs? Rejected. 
Internships? Rejected.
Grants? Rejected. 

I put hours into my applications for things and I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m starting to get tired of working hard in school and other areas of my life when things keep turning out so shitty. It’s really hard when I’ve been at this school for over a year and everyone I know has at least found a place on campus but I just keep getting rejected. People are already talking about internships they have lined up for the spring or the summer and I really need the money from a spring internship or something, but I keep getting rejected from things. 

I’ve tried research assistantships but I get rejected from those too. After over a year at Harvard, I’m really fucking tired of the rejection and it genuinely feels like I was accepted as a big joke so that they could have someone that other students could compare themselves to when they were feeling down. 

I’ve tried CAMHS too and when they had me wait for over a month to be seen, that felt like another rejection. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m sort of spiraling and I feel like I need something to go right, even something small so I can feel like life is worth living again and that I haven’t damned myself to 4 yrs of misery at Harvard, but I can’t find that thing.

Was just wondering if anyone could provide insight into GSAS life (like maybe how you guys found it different from undergrad, socially and academically) or the MS CSE course (e.g. whether coursemates tend to be close to one another). The social aspect is a big thing for me since colleges in Oxford/Cambridge are pretty tight-knit and you end up making really great friends.

I'd also be keen to learn more about career prospects (particularly investment banking/consulting), as well as the prestige of the MS CSE program. I've heard that master's programs in the US are often seen as cash cows and that undergrads, rather than master's students, are mainly recruited for BB/EB IBD or MBB.

This is as opposed to continuing on as a 4th year undergrad at Oxbridge. Oxbridge undergrad is seen as the most prestigious thing you can do in Europe - for example, MBB in London almost exclusively recruit from Oxbridge undergrad - so from a practical standpoint, would it just make more sense to stay in the UK?

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person and any usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me.

I've had visitors get right up on me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

People who are not students are hanging around and getting way too close no matter where you are.

Yesterday, I saw a woman let her child **urinate** on the grass in the middle of the Old Yard. Where people (like me) sit and study.

In short - students have a reason to be here - you (random families, tourists, locals who consider Harvard a 'park') **do not**. Not during this semester, I mean.

0.0,1598780830.0,79.0,harvard,"Hello. Throwaway here.

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

I am not a Harvard student myself, but a few things here confused me, and I was wondering whether anyone here would have insight into *why* some survey results are... the way they are.

• The number of students with an income of 500K+ seemed to hang around 13-14% for the classes of 2017/18, 15% for 2019/20, and 17% for 2021/22 (the class of 2023 had a “prefer not to say” option. Is this just inflation, is this trend insignificant, or is the number of ultra-rich students slowly creeping up?


• In the classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019, the % Jewish was 9.5, 9.8, and 10.1 respectively. Since then, it has not exceeded 7.7, with a new low of 5.3 for the class of 2023 (2022 was 5.4%). Is this response bias, or are fewer Jews matriculating?

• In the classes of 2017 and 2018, 12.5 and 12.8% of students had received mental health counseling. This number has crept up through the high-teens, and is now at 25.3% for the class of 2023, up from 21.8% for the class of 2022. Is this because of greater access to therapy, admissions changes, or a general societal trend?

• Most “National Politics” questions were “culture war” related, with some being *extremely*  niche. Why are there questions on transgender individuals in the military and separation of families at the border, but not a *single* question on education, healthcare, or economics? These are generally considered (along with climate change) to be the most mainstream voter issues.

I also wanted to say, the class of 2023 looks *quite* impressive. The whole report is fascinating as well — I am extremely impressed.

I am an incoming sophomore.

I’m sure a few more will punch me as well based on the work I put in freshman year meeting people. Does anyone have insight into how virtual punch will be conducted though?

Should I change my address in the directory? 

Additionally, I recognize that some of the future punch events might take place in person, so I have been making arrangements to travel safely to and from these locations (I’ve heard NYC, Miami Beach, Montana and Los Angeles are some of the potential locations being thrown around this year).

I'm not really thinking of applying to these schools, more so I am just looking for information that is vague and the program is so new.

Obviously the first thing you do when you decide what master's program is your target is google what schools actually offer the masters. Scrolling down a bit past the ads and the 6th university website listed for Biotech masters was Harvard Extension. I'm here because I clicked on it to see what's up since I clicked the other 5 universities before it.

The whole process of earning admission with classes is pretty strange to me, but it seems interesting. Except I only heard of Harvard Extension prior for being a school of Ivy Rejects (it's quite a foul name), so is this program even worth the time, effort, and money for a Harvard University degree: Master of Liberal Arts (ALM) in Extension Studies, field: Biotechnology. (Copy pasted from the website.)

Seemed strange so I did look into the school a little more out of curiosity to see if they offer another ms in biotech (curiosity because of the strangeness), short answer yes but you have to take it with the MBA. Why? I mean sure I probably wouldn't get in with my GPA but if someone who really just wants the MS from Harvard in Biotech, why is it combined?  I looked a little further and even if you get denied by the dual program you can still get into the MBA program only, but not the MS program only? This approach for the degrees in biotech from Harvard's graduate programs seems strange so I was hoping for some clarification since I can't find much on MS/MBA program (it started in 2019 and has 1 page of info...).

---

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

Removed | Not Removed

[Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5ji6qb/can_i_tell_my_friends_i_go_to_harvard_if_its_hes/) | [Exhibit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/aixskc/hes_alb_acronym_history/)

I hope the distinction is clear from these examples. If not, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain further. 

---

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action.

Although the first rule is very clear, one third to one half of the posts in the sub are about admissions. But we know that it is not that people are willingly violating the rules, they are all first- time posters and do not read the rules. As such, bans or other deterrents do not work. Seeing other subs that deal with similar problems, I have two proposals:

1. Get Automoderator to comment on posts with keywords such as ""admissions"", ""alumni"", ""waitlist"" ""transfer"". The comment can remind them the first rule. This way, they are likely to read the rule and remove the post if appropriate;                              or,
2. Require posts including these keywords  to go through moderator approval. As things stand now, mods have to go through them anyway because they get reported.

The cough is just a side affect of this, by the time your coughing it’s already done damage to your kidneys, brain, literally every organ. It mutates every two weeks, with a mutation in Italy resulting in it being up to 10x more contagious then the Wuhan strain. 

It’s going to be an absolute shit show at college campuses in the fall. Headlines like “Every student at Cornell forced to quarantine, 20 dead, over 60% of students positive”. Harvard starting small with a pilot program they are likely to be able to manage is the smart thing to do. And bringing back freshmen first is also the smart thing to do.

If you're like me you should have gotten an email from [harvard@electionservicescorp.com](mailto:harvard@electionservicescorp.com) today with your Your Election Validation Number to vote in the Harvard University's Board of Overseers and for Elected Directors of the Harvard Alumni Association (HAA). This is the highest democratically elected Alumni board at Harvard and they have been filled with HAA selected alumni for a long long long time. So a group called Harvard Forward is working to democratically elect 5 candidates to the Board of Overseers to move Harvard forward (get it?) on divesting from fossil fuels, committing more resources to climate-focused initiatives, including recent alumni into our governance, and giving a greater voice to students. 

One of the candidates (John Beatty) is a friend from my time at Harvard's Environmental Action Committee so I can attest that this group is filled with super-stars. 

**Harvard Forward Five for Overseers**: Margaret ""Midge"" Purce, Jayson Toweh, Lisa Bi Huang, John Beatty, Thea Sebastian 

**Endorsed HAA Directors (choose 6 of 7):** 

Kelsey Trey Leonard, Joyce Y. Zhang, Mallika J. Marshall, Vanessa Zoltan ​​​​​​, Santiago Creuheras, Benjamin D. Wei, Michael D. Lewis

Instructions to vote: [https://www.harvardforward.org/vote](https://www.harvardforward.org/vote) 

A little about Harvard Forward: 

 **We recognize that there are many things happening in the world right now that need your attention.** The coronavirus pandemic is ongoing, and the Black Lives Matter movement still needs our unfailing support and attention. Many Harvard affiliates have stepped up in the fight to create a more just society and to support those who are suffering. Now it is time for Harvard, as an institution, to follow in their footsteps and take up the mantle of moral leadership and decisive action.   


The Harvard Forward candidates aren't just running on a platform of climate action, responsible investing, and inclusive governance. **They're running to send a message that alumni demand better than the status quo**; that alumni are looking to Harvard to take a stance on the critical issues that are directly threatening the wellbeing and existence of current and future generations.  


**This means addressing not just climate change but also systemic racism**, and Harvard Forward is committed to making anti-racism a larger part of our platform. We're currently reaching out to those in the Harvard community who are leading anti-racism organizing to find out how we can best support their efforts, and we'll share our progress with you as it develops.   


**We know that a majority of** **Harvard** **alumni believe that** **Harvard** **can and must do better.** We simply need to get the word to them that this year's Board election is the opportunity to create a mandate for change.  

If we get these guys on the board - **this would make history** by having candidates elected and represented by the people, not by being nominated by HAA. Last year less than 12% of alumni voted - if you see this and vote and then share it, it makes a real difference. Our community is small and I'm sure you know friends that would be interested as well - please forward.",Vote today in Harvard's elections,t3_hjnb2v,12.0,0.89

Last August, in a lawsuit brought by fraternities and sororities to challenge the policy, Judge Gorton of the United States District Court in Boston denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the case. In essence, the court accepted the plaintiffs’ legal theory that the policy, although adopted to counteract discrimination based on sex, is itself an instance of discrimination based on sex. The court reasoned that the policy applies to men but not women who seek to join all-male social organizations and applies to women but not men who seek to join all-female social organizations, and that this constitutes sex discrimination under federal law. In reaching this view, Judge Gorton relied heavily on the reasoning in one of the appellate decisions (Zarda v. Altitude Express) that was affirmed by the Supreme Court. It now seems clear that Judge Gorton would ultimately grant judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor in the pending lawsuit and that Harvard would be legally barred from further enforcing the policy. 

In view of the Supreme Court’s decision, following Judge Gorton’s prior opinion in the lawsuit against Harvard, the Corporation consulted with the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Dean of Harvard College, and the University’s General Counsel last week. We together came to the view that, in the circumstances, the College will not be able to carry forward with the existing policy under the prevailing interpretation of federal law. As a result, following a vote of the Corporation on Friday to rescind its prior approval, the policy will no longer be enforced.",Sanctions against final clubs were just lifted,t3_hi98yi,14.0,0.79

- what are some downsides to this program being online? Time will tell, but I’m interested in hearing if people think this format will decrease the value of the program?

5. Econ 50:

Great intro class that requires basically no knowledge of econ, or math, or coding, or much of anything useful, and since you are a humanities kid thats probably right up your alley. 

4. Math 21b 

Linear algebra, really? It doesn't get much easier than this. y = mx +b, come on, that's baby shit. This is just like learning what lines are, the only tricky part is now they call them vectors––big whoop. 

3. Applied Math 22a

coming in at just 8 hours of work per week according to the Q guide this is like linear algebra but, like, applied, sounds easy to me. The prof uses the word ""gentle"" in the course description, it doesn't get much easier than that. 

2. Math 23a

So this one is like the baby linear algebra mentioned earlier but now there is some ""real analysis"" tacked on. Oh boy, I go day to day looking at real things, now you want me to analyze them? Cake walk!

1.Math 55a

Founded in Harvard earlier this year, [Students vs Pandemics](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/20/harvard-student-pandemic-group/) is an interdisciplinary group of grad and undergrad students building community and empowering students to make a positive impact on health and overall wellness during times of crisis. Our three primary goals are to improve transparency and communication, build community, and identify needs and innovate solutions. We share health education material, resources for students, and opportunities to serve our greater community through our[ resources spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTerz_XiSYghoEMn01biDnqqBM_pQIa3S8o-BhEKy-s/edit#gid=531738015) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studentsvspandemics/), write policy memos for state legislators, organize virtual COVID hackathons, address the digital disparity, and launch other initiatives. SvP gained over 100 volunteer members within a week of its launch and is now there are over 370 members from different chapters all over the country (more chapters oversea are being built!)

We are constantly looking for experts in all fields. As we know, we are in a huge public health crisis from COVID-19 and systemic racism; and interdisciplinary efforts are needed more than ever. We are also listening to community needs to tailor our efforts to better help the community (so if you have any feedback or concerns about a certain topic during this crisis, don't hesitate to contact us).

Using a throwaway account because I'm usually more of a lurker on reddit than a poster. 

Now that 6 grad schools are officially going online for the Fall international students have been advised to not move to the US until in-person classes restart. I (naively) had an idea in my head of moving to the Boston area if classes went online in order to be in the same timezone/ have access to resources/ have some resemblance of a social life/ familiarise myself with where I had anticipated my professional and academic life would be for the next two years... 

I'm now trying to decide between deferring for a year when it's unlikely that I'll get a new job (for context my contract ran out and wasn't renewed because of covid) or starting online and hoping that I'll be able to move for the Spring semester (which obviously can't be guaranteed to be in person).

I'm an incoming freshman at Harvard, and have been doing research into whether any of my AP credit will be transferable. On the Advanced Standing portal of the Undergraduate website, there have been some changes listed to Harvard's system for the Class of 2024, namely that...

&gt;Admitted students who enter the College as freshmen in Fall 2020 (the Class of 2024), and all subsequent classes, will not be eligible to receive Harvard College degree credit for pre-matriculation credentials earned in secondary school. This means that Advanced Placement examinations, the International Baccalaureate diploma, and international credentials will no longer be recognized for Harvard College credit toward the degree beginning with the students who enter the College in Fall 2020. These examinations will continue to serve as valuable placement tools, and certain examinations may still fulfill the College’s language requirement.

Do you know if it's still required to send Harvard the scores for this year? I'm losing a little bit of motivation to still study these next few weeks now that the scores won't be accepted for credit. If a student were to fail his or her AP exams, would that be grounds to possibly rescind them? Is there a way to still cancel planned AP exams before taking them? Do you know if matriculating students are required to send AP exam scores or can you choose not to?

With everything going on, I completely understand any guesses at this point are pure speculation. But, I suspect some of you are substantially more informed on this than me. I know Harvard accepted 30 more people this year (1980) to maybe account for any covid-19 related deferrals or offer refusals. My question is how much will those 30 more admitted students affect the usage of the waitlist this year. 

Last year, 65 people were accepted off the waitlist. Any chance that number will be higher this year. And if so, how much so? Something interesting to note is that school who historically haven't utilized waitlist at all like Princeton and Dartmouth started to pull from the waitlist before May 1. And, UPenn dean of admissions openly announced, a few days after ivy day, that he predicted they would heavily use the waitlist this year. Granted, these schools don't have the yield Harvard has historically had, but its still weird how they resorted to the waitlist that early when they haven't admitted anyone off it in years past.

So, I’m a Harvard class of ‘24 member who’s close friends with someone who worked with THE prefrosh on the project that’s been blowing up these past few days, and it occurred to me that I’ll be spending the next four years alongside him. There’s no doubt that I’ll be uncomfortable the entire time, and I plan to go into relatively the same field, which means I’ll probably be in many of the same classes and perhaps student organizations. I’ve been considering deferring a year to avoid feeling anxious the entire time, but I know how crazy it sounds to take a year off to avoid being in the same class as a particular person. Would deferring a year largely because of this be ridiculous of a move? (Side note: I’m happy with the prospect of a gap year and will definitely find meaningful things to do with my time.

The problem is that the decision date for deferring my acceptance is May 1 and I can't change later when the situation is more clear.

Harvard announced today that they will have Fall 2020, but have made no decisions about online or on-campus learning. If they go totally online, then they will give another opportunity to defer and I will do that. However, my question is: if the fall semester begins on campus, is it worthwhile to take a gap year? I really want a good freshman experience and the best possible four years that I can. I know that next year is not going to be normal, there will probably be no sporting events or big gatherings, maybe limitations on parties, some online learning, and the chance that everyone gets sent home again.

- social atmosphere

- it’s harvard (world wide prestige — kind of a dream school for me)

- their cs department isn’t on the same level as MIT

- maybe less opportunities for cs internships, since Harvard seems to be leaning more liberal arts

- maybe more competitive for CS internships since like 1/2 the people major in CS

More Qs: are all the College classes just pre-recorded or is there a live Zoom component? I'm also curious, is there a difference in perspective amongst grad students, mid-career grads and college students?

I'm a grad student and absolutely love learning online. Most grad students have also spent time working and learning to delineate between work, school and leisure - a learned bevavior that quickly becomes important. One of the reasons it works from me, aside from my learning style, is the flexibility it affords my work. I've lived in three countries this last year, mostly for work, and am able to continue my classes uninterrupted. I especially appreciate the live Zoom classes and the interaction with other students. I don't think that'd make a world of a difference if it was in person (unless we're looking to make friends - but even then, I remain in touch with quite a few students post-semester.)

Initially, I thought it was going to be a breeze since I worked during undergrad and managed well; but, online learning requires a new type of discipline that took months to cultivate. (I saved my in class needs for learning languages but also transitioned those to online format once I left the country.) Making that transition isn't easy but can be rewarding.

Homeless individuals are at high risk for contracting COVID-19 and may lack access to adequate testing and treatment, as well as a safe way to self-isolate.

I'm a newcomer, who is going to be attending one of the graduate programs here (SEAS). No previous residential history on East Coast, so this is a big leap for me, and due to no physical admit welcome programs because of COVID, so some of the knowledge that organically gets transferred seems to be missing for me.

1. HUHS options seem pretty bad. The facilities look a sad and underinvested, seems priced as much as off-campus housing, lack in-unit laundry, and charge a whole lot extra for parking. Coming in from pretty suburban lifestyle. Do graduate people (late 20's - early 30's ) at Harvard choose HUHS? What's the draw I am missing here?
2. Off-campus housing: Any neighborhoods I should avoid within? I can't actually physically visit right now due to COVID (in west coast). Any input on neighborhoods would be appreciated. Places in review: Allston, North Brookline, West Cambridge, Cambridgeport, Riverside, The Port, Inman Square, Ward Two.

Harvard's history is marked with numerous occasions when crisis lead to momentous change for the University's constituent schools. The most notable of these events for the purpose of my post is how Radcliffe Women began attending lectures with men only when male attendance dropped during the Second World War. Now is such a moment for the Extension School. 

Once we have contained or survived the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus (and we will survive), all members of the Harvard community should note how much of a resource the Extension School is for the entire university. Not only has it be tacitly (and intently) preparing for widespread distance education for generations, it also provides the University with insight and a diversity of perspectives the University would not have otherwise. 

Furthermore, HES reaches some of the poorest, and most disadvantaged people affiliated with the University. Presidents Faust and Bacow have discussed how Harvard needs to use its ""greatness"" to do more ""good"". Well... HES has been at the forefront of this goal since 1909.

While most people in r/Harvard may demand for the ""In Extension Studies"" tag to be removed from diplomas, I suggest 3 other reforms that will integrate HES more with the broader Harvard community.

1) Open University Apartment Housing up to HES degree students, at least undergrads. Students in Columbia's undergraduate parallel to HES, the School of General Studies (GS), are allowed to enter the housing lottery for their version of University Apartment Housing.

2) Allow HES degree candidates to enroll directly for all FAS classes (prerequisites permitting). Again, Columbia already does this which results in more veterans, mothers, minorities, and professional artists in their classes.

3) Seek donations for (or just build with the \~$40B endowment) a ""House"" for extension programs. This house can rent out rooms to students visiting for on-campus weekends, or to full time students taking all their courses on-campus. It also would give the Extension School a more visible presence on campus, and a new permanent home for a revived Grossman Library. (As an urban planner, I think the Church St. parking lot would be a great place for an ""Extension House"".)

I hope some of you agree with this assessment. Harvard's response to the coronavirus opens a door for HES to ascend to a place within the University it already should hold. I encourage everyone to email the school, the University, and any professor they know to highlight the importance of the Extension School for the entire University. The coronavirus may linger, but it will become old news as quickly as it became a pandemic. Its legacy must be used to improve the University, and one way this can be accomplished is to support the Extension School, and its degree students as much as any other degree candidate.",A Pivotal Moment for the Extension School,t3_fhi4x4,24.0,0.91

It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&amp;adults=1&amp;check_in=2020-04-22&amp;check_out=2020-04-30&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from.

I pull the Cliff bar out of my pocket and I asked him, ""Hey man I just bought this, do you want it?""

All I’ve been able to find on Harvard’s website is that I can either transfer 32 credits worth of AP tests or none at all, and transferring those 32 credits would mean I’d be in Academic Standing.

0.0,1581641533.0,31.0,harvard,"As I stood in the mirror last night and admitted to myself that I wanted to declare econ I mentally prepared myself for the onslaught that living my truth as a lover of economics would entail. 

I first want to say that declaring econ is not a choice, I didn't wake up one day and decide ""I want to pick the most popular concentration that offers some of the most lucrative job opportunities after graduation"",  I woke up one morning clutching a copy of Wealth of Nations and blabbering to my roommate about reverse causality. 

To some of you it may seem like I am equating the struggle of being an ec concentrator with that of LGBTQ Americans, and you would be right, that's exactly what I am doing (because this is satire). Some would say that the backlash ec conentators face is actually more nefarious than regular-ol homophobia; I think much of the hatred of econ is based in the view that it is twinged with pre-professionalism and that students in the field  have merely forgone Harvard's fantastic academic opportunities to study something that will get them a job at Goldman. Regardless of whether or not that is true, the notion that Harvard students should not focus on finding a job and making money post grad has undertones of a quiet privilege, deaf to students from economically insecure backgrounds who do not feel they have the luxury of entering the job market without classically marketable job skills, and inconsiderate of other colleges and universities that serve merely as engines of economic mobility and not academic playgrounds. 

This is not to say that every hist and lit concentrator is some trust fund baby and every econ concentrator is a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who wants to work in investment banking to support his or her family, far from it, this is merely to say we would be remiss if we did not examine the ways in which class, privilege, and economic security permeate our decisions to come to Harvard and how we decide to spend our time while we are here.

My current interest is in international affairs, and as of now I envision my career path as something in that field, whether it be working for the government or a think tank/NGO or something like that. 

Going in, I have a relatively firm belief that my primary concentration will be Government, but I’m undecided on whether or not I want my secondary field to be in East Asian Studies or German.  I feel somewhat compelled to worry about this now because I saw that I would have to be fluent in either language (Mandarin or German) in order to take advantage of study abroad in those areas, as well as taking advantage of internships/work abroad, so I’ll have to learn the language prior to junior year I think. If this is wrong, or if this is something y’all think my academic advisor or someone like that can help me with in time, please let me know. 

My justification for studying German is that I have a deep love of German culture and history, and the idea of studying abroad in any German speaking country appeals to me. Also, if at some point in my career I have to work abroad, I’d rather be living in Germany/Austria/Switzerland/some German speaking country rather than China. Also, Germany being arguably the most important country in Europe, I think it will have use. 

My justification for studying Mandarin is that I find Sino-American relations extremely interesting from the policy perspective, and I think that it’ll become the most important country America has relations with, so studying Mandarin will bear the most fruit. My current conception is that living in China if I must would not be that nice (at least compared to German-speaking nations), but please tell me if that conception is wrong. 

I’m kinda torn, so guidance would be appreciated.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people’s availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of college students to the platform and it has been working great so far.

&gt;On November 27, 2019, Harvard University denied tenure to an ethnic-studies professor specializing in Dominican identity. Students and faculty at Harvard and across the country sprung into protest mode. The failure to tenure Lorgia García Peña, they said, resulted from Harvard’s racism. NBC Nightly News, the *New York Times*, the *Boston Globe*, and other outlets covered the controversy from the same angle.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, García Peña had been catapulted into the academic firmament with a speed that most non-intersectional professors can only dream of. She has been showered with benefits. Thirty-one percent of Harvard’s tenure-track professors lost their tenure bids in the 2018‒19 academic year without alleging bias, since most of those failed contenders were white. Yet García Peña has gone through her academic career playing the victim, reflexively accusing those around her of white supremacy. In this, she is a perfect synecdoche for ethnic studies itself, which also stakes its identity on the conceit that it is in a nonstop battle for survival against the forces of racism and exclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;To the contrary, ethnic studies is ascendant. It is spreading rapidly throughout K‒12 schools; its ideology has already bled into the political realm. It’s worth reviewing García Peña’s career as an emblem of a fast-rising academic field whose worldview is taking over American culture.",Ethnic Studies 101: Playing the Victim.

0.0,1578965509.0,44.0,harvard,"Last semester was overall a really good one for me. I met so many great people, and I am grateful I was able to so quickly find a niche at the big bustling nerve-wracking world of Harvard.

A big part of that was thanks to the Harvard Crimson, which was far more welcoming and accepting than I could have hoped for. It's truly such a great organization. Its comp process was long and challenging, but my comp directors made the experience completely manageable, light-hearted, and fun. We got to publish multiple articles and benefitted from the experience and expertise of thoughtful, wise editors.

So the Crimson-ICE controversy absolutely broke my heart. On multiple occasions, it brought me to tears. I am a sensitive person, and I try my best to be a moral person. I'm quite left-wing, and strongly support abolish ICE, the decriminalization of immigration, and taking in as many refugees as possible.

And yet I can't escape a simple, clear conviction I have come to: The Crimson was in the right, Act on a Dream in the wrong.

Act on a Dream was absolutely unreasonable in their demands and thoughtless in their actions. The main purpose of a public protest is to demonstrate public support for a cause. The free press has an obligation to scrutinize and duly report on protests, which benefits just social movements by spreading their message and reach. Reaching out to a government agency for comment is never an endorsement of said agencies' actions, nor does it inherently put students in danger. If ICE wanted to prey on undocumented students at Harvard, they would do so regardless of if a comment is asked. ICE's non-comment on the article is demonstrative of their uncaring attitudes to the lives of this country's many brilliant and brave undocumented students. Therefore, the Crimson, without resorting to biased reporting, was able to demonstrate the strength and moral conviction of the Abolish ICE movement in Harvard's community.

Then, Act on a Dream threw that all away by attacking the Crimson for conducting a routine component of journalism. The boycott by various Harvard student groups only did three things: ensure that their efforts and movements would not be reported on with their voice accounted for, cause people both in and outside of the Harvard community to think less of these vital causes, and spread misinformation about the actions and the nature of the Crimson as an organization. I've talked to many students, all otherwise smart and lovely people, who had completely warped views of the situation. Some thought the Crimson literally gave ICE the names of undocumented students, or that we collaborated with them to undermine the protest. I heard people talking about vandalizing the Crimson's headquarters. When people don't trust the Crimson, they will have trouble gaining a full, nuanced perspective on complex campus issues.

Student activists have wasted so much time and effort attacking their fellow students, and allies in making Harvard a fair and just community. It makes me so upset the wasted potential this unnecessary conflict created.

I want us all to move on

So, as an anonymous internet person, I hope that we all can find peace and cooperation in the next semester. I hereby give full, unconditional forgiveness to the people who have slandered my peers, and caused the national press to ridicule the Harvard activist community. I love you all, and I know most of you are good people.

If you want to make a difference on campus, one of the best ways is to comp the Crimson this coming semester. We have a generous financial aid program and do not cut anyone during the comp. All are welcome. Love and mercy everyone.",Harvard Crimson,t3_eoe0uq,44.0,0.89

0.0,1578010247.0,30.0,harvard,"(TLDR at the bottom) Hi I’m was recently accepted REA to Harvard, but I’m actually pretty worried about attending the school. I don’t want to be rude or call anyone out, but I’m afraid of Harvard’s social sphere. A fair share of posts in this subreddit are about how lonely and sad Harvard students feel, the lack of a dating life, and so on. This just kinda worries me a bit. I kinda hoped getting into Harvard was like this golden ticket and life would be all butterflies and rainbows after I started college. Obviously, this was super naive, but now it seems like it might even be the opposite. I already struggle with sadness and loneliness right now and I’d hate for college to amplify them. 

I’m already somewhat introverted. In high school, I finally made some solid friends, but it took until senior year for me to find them.  I’m afraid that finding friends at Harvard might take too long. I wish I thought of this earlier because by now it’s too late to apply to other schools, specifically MIT. MIT seems like it might be a better fit for me (I want to study comp sci and am pretty nerdy in liking engineering), but the all-nighter horror stories and my annoying mit tour guide scared me away from applying, which I now sincerely regret. MIT seems to have a ton of sciencey, nerdy people that I get along well with. So far all the Harvard people I met are super into social justice, liberal arts, and debating, which is fine and cool, but not really the kind of people I associate with.

Also, a minor point about the people, everyone seems to be way more accomplished than me by just looking at their Instagram pages. Imposter syndrome is already coming in hot :(

Finally, sports are a minor issue I have about Harvard. I was hoping to play my sport at Harvard, but even if I could play, the D1 level of athletics seems very hard core and I don’t know if I could handle it, if even afforded the opportunity. I am aware of club options, but I don’t know much about it. 

I should also state that I am still almost certainly coming to Harvard. I didn’t really apply to any school that I would choose over Harvard. I really just want to know how I can make sure the social life goes well for me. I realize that it might be early to start worrying about this since I haven’t even been at Harvard for one day, but I’d rather be prepared for the worst. Thanks

TLDR: I am going to Harvard in the fall, but I’m afraid that a sciencey introvert like me will have trouble making friends, dating, and not getting depressed. It might be early to worry about this, but I’d like to know about all I can in advance. Any advice on how to avoid that would be super appreciated.",How to be happy at Harvard,t3_ej6w8z,30.0,0.89

I know this sub gets tons of posts just like this, and right now is probably prime time as we’re all reeling from the semester and getting back long-anticipated grades. I’ve spent tons of time brooding these thoughts, and hesitating to post because we’ve all heard this story before, but idk man, I really want these feelings off my chest. Either way I really am sorry in advance for the ranty long post ahead.

It’s 11:22 pm on the 31st and I’m unironically sitting in my bed in my dead quiet house while the rest of the world is celebrating New Years’ Eve. It’s not that I didn’t want to party. I just didn’t get invited anywhere. It’s given me even more time to ruminate than was already unhealthy, and now all the bad thoughts are just melting together and really letting me have it.
 
My first semester kind of sucked. I know it wasn’t the worst it possibly could have been, but it sure wasn’t good. Now I know this is pretty normal, but so many things that were bad about it are part of broader problems, and I know they won’t just magically resolve themselves. I feel really angry lately, which is just an intensification of previous, constant feelings of sadness, emptiness, paranoia and self-blame that have stretched back since early in high school. When I have memories about the semester, if I close my eyes and re-envision my state of mind when I had time to think— on those routine walks to/from the dhall, to class, wherever— with minimal exception, I could only ever recall feeling angry, sad, or just nothing. It was constant by around the second week of classes. Feeling nothing but either distinctly bad, or just nothing. Just flat. And that flat feeling wasn’t much better than bad, because it would devolve into bad at the drop of a hat. The same didn’t go for good; something cool could happen, and I could feel relaxed for once, but the bad ruminations and mean inner criticisms would crowd out those feelings so quickly that I look back and hardly remember the good times even happened. By the end of the semester I felt like I was slowly losing my spirit. Just fading into something vaguer and vaguer every day. I felt like who I was there was just some even worse, even less likable version of whatever confused sad thing I was before.

My approach to these feelings this semester was mostly to isolate myself when I got into a really negative spiral, which ended up being pretty often after the first few weeks. I would avoid developing my friendships, not because I didn’t want to have friends, but because despite my efforts to cheer up, it was honestly really, really difficult to not appear cold and dismissive and terse in conversation even though none of that had a single thing to do with the other person. It’s not that I turned into an absolute asshat during those moods, or was explicitly mean, and it’s certainly not that I never talked to people. I really did have a some normal, good days, some great meals where I felt just fine and slipped back into my sort of funny, chill self. It’s just that I didn’t do it enough, and now I’m worried the withdrawn brooding side is all some people might remember. I could have done so much better. I just gave up and withdrew into myself too many times in the dhall or in classes or meetings with my EC. I could have done so much better. Not that I even know how to manage it, but I could have tried harder. I’m really concerned about the long-term effects of that behavior on my future ability to make friends here, because I’m paranoid that people have an image of me as this angry loner. Maybe kind of irrational, maybe not. I’m just angry at myself I let that side come out so often. We’re all people, we all get angry. Come on verisad, you’re supposed to develop methods to control yourself when you’re an adult. I’ve done a shit job with that. I shouldn’t have let it get this out of hand.

I’m just really disgusted with myself. I feel like that’s the best way I could describe it sometimes. Like when I kind of step outside myself, and look inward, I kind of cringe, because ew, look at me. I’m not performing particularly well at school (and know a few of my peers did consistently better, plus were good wholesome people, so the ‘it’s only first semester’ stuff is not really a tenable excuse), I have no friends, my jokes aren’t really that funny, I’m kind of weird and tryhard and awkward. Any people I met in the dhall, at my main EC, that I SHOULD have pursued friendships with, I either only half did, or just didn’t, because I guess I couldn’t deal with the effort of following it up, or just couldn’t reign in my emotions. I’ve even gained fifteen pounds, so when I’m not degrading myself in my head for whatever reason, no worries, I could always just look at my body and be fucking disgusted all over again. I came home thinking maybe being away from Annenberg would help me at least begin shedding the weight, slowly, since we generally don’t keep excess food in the house . . . nope, no change. And too bad the iota of motivation I actually did have to go work out in the beginning of the semester, when I got myself to the gym a few times, has totally burnt out.

I know we all have a mean inner critical voice and this is it talking. But the thing is, I feel like when we tend to say things like ‘don’t listen to the critical inner voice, because it’s irrational,’ my problem with that is that I feel like mine is, actually, pretty ‘rational’. I really do seem to deserve some, if not most, of the self-criticism. My personality is lacking somewhere. Not to make this about logic or anything, but it’s the inference to the best explanation. Take the real-life evidence, I don’t have friends. I’m not getting hit up. Never dated anyone. I’m a lonely person. I am capable of being outgoing and somewhat funny, but somewhere along the way the motor just burns out and somehow I can’t make and keep friends. I’m not extremely desirable friend or partner material, and I am doing this to myself, and am not getting better at not doing it to myself. 

I know it can change. Anything can change. It could get better, sure. Then it could get worse again. I told myself that things would change for the better in high school, and senior year — forget it, after Dec. 13th I thought I was holding that golden ticket, finally on my way to feeling ‘normal’ and fulfilled and with my own crowd. I remember the fever of the holidays. I binged the housing day videos when they came out, memorized all the flags and mascots. I watched that Adams rap video one in awe, feeling all fuzzy, like I was in on this special inside joke now. Well surprise, reversal of fortune, now who even knows if I’ll have a blocking group. I’ll have less than a month to figure it out. I just wish I gave it a little more effort. I couldn’t just suck it up and get back on the horse. That’s what life is about, getting back on the horse. And I couldn’t do it, and I don't know how to get better at doing it. I wish I could sorry to any person I was ever unfairly dismissive toward. I just want them to know how sorry I am, and that it wasn't their fault. It's also absolutely awful to consider the possibility that I could have contributed to even more bad feelings in others when I acted like that, and just continued the cycle and made it worse for everyone and helped screw over the aggregate pleasure, even if just a little. If anyone our there ever had someone just act mad around you for no reason, I'm sorry on their behalf. Maybe it was me. You didn't deserve that.

If anyone else had similar feelings first semester and wants to share any insight, I would really appreciate it. I'm currently talking to someone at CAMHS, and having some sort of evaluation soon where I guess they determine whether I should get on meds. That's kind of worrisome in its own right because my parents' divorce is leaving my mom in a really awful financial situation, and getting outside treatment is costly and I don't even want to think about stressing her out more, but we'll see. If anyone found other ways of coping that helped in the first year, it would mean a lot. 

I’m sorry this was a dump. If it’s too rambling, I’m sorry, delete it, or I will. I know it’s like anything else we all see and hear about here, but I seriously have nowhere else to put down these feelings. I hope everyone on this sub has a great New Years. You all work so hard and deserve the best. Whoever you are, I seriously hope you could find some solace from whatever you’re going through right now. I’m sure we could all use that right now.

I am a student from Southern California who will be moving (with a car) to Cambridge in August 2020 to start a masters program at Harvard.

So with that said, could any fellow crazy car owners please share their thoughts or point me in the right direction? I am particularly interested in the following:

* What is the average cost for an off-street parking spot in Cambridge? Any recommended companies/landlords?
* If I am staying for 1 year, will I likely get busted for having out of state plates? According to the MA laws I read, there is no grace period to register your vehicle once you are an MA resident. That is in theory, how is it in practice?
* Is it easy to obtain a student parking permit? Are the garages fairly secure? How hard is it to find a space, typically?

0.0,1576211433.0,34.0,harvard,"Hey guys, 

So, idk if this is the right spot for this, but here goes:

This is my first semester (I’m a first-year) and it’s been the most miserable few months of my life. Every day I’ve been here I’ve just been sad. I know I’m clinically depressed and all that stuff, but I’ve never been this bad to the point where–now that I’ve got to take finals–I just want to curl up and die somewhere. 


Socially, I had a group for a little bit but there was a bit of a falling out–it wasn’t really anyone’s fault, but it was enough for me to distance myself and so I lost any sense of social belonging earlier in the semester. In terms of clubs, it’s just been a steady stream of rejections. And in terms of academics, I push myself so damn hard and I still get really shitty grades and I’m probably going to just end up with all Cs and maybe a B if I’m lucky. I just feel really inadequate all the time and everyone is always talking about grade inflation and complains about their A- or whatever, meanwhile I’m literally at the bottom of all my classes and I kind of just want to die because of it. I did go to a kind of shitty public school where I didn’t have to try very hard in general, but I’ve always pushed myself and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to fix anything in any aspect of my life and it’s been so incredibly frustrating. My finals have all been ass, even though I’ve given up what little time I made for myself to throw myself 100% into preparing for them. 

I tried to convince myself that, at the very least I could do something fun or cool over the summer because Harvard’s name–no matter how much I hate this place and no matter how miserable I’ve been–is powerful enough to open doors. I realize now how misguided that was, because I’m on-track to go home and be depressed for 3 months over summer break and nothing else. Maybe pick up an odd job or two but nothing relevant to my goals. 

I don’t know who to go to for support. CAMHS gave me the option of antidepressants or weird fucking support groups, that I know wouldn’t help me. My parents think that Harvard is the best place on earth and that I’m silly to be so sad while I’m here. I don’t have friends really. I’m just so at my wit’s end. I know it’s only one semester and I’m probably just a whiny idiot for complaining this much, but I really can’t see any way out of this mess. I don’t know if I should consider transferring, and even if I did, I don’t know what school would take my shitty GPA and useless/non-existent extracurriculars. A part of me thought that maybe this was something to discuss with PAFs or my advisor, but it seems like PAFs are just there to cart in food for study breaks and advisors to lift the hold on your account. 

And, even if I do stay at this school, I don’t see how things would be different next semester or the one after that or the one after that. It’s clear that I’m not academically capable enough for this school and there doesn’t seem to be a way for me to fix that. I’m just over everything kind of at this point. Life, Harvard,  everything else. 

I’m on mobile and I have fat fucking fingers so I apologize for any grammatical errors. 

I’d appreciate any advice or something. I don’t know. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I just feel like I need to scream myself hoarse but this the next best thing, I guess.",Shitty Semester?,t3_e9z4g6,34.0,0.93

&gt;On Tuesday, December 10, 2019 El Jefe's Taqueria and the Harvard Varsity Club will be sponsoring the 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Fundraiser. For each of the last two years, we've had over 2,000 customers come to El Jefe's on this day and have raised over $27,000 each year. In addition, thousands more donated to the Benson M. Abercrombie ’21 Fund, established by the Harvard Varsity Club. Ben was a freshman at Harvard in Sept 2017 and was a defensive back for the Harvard Crimson Football Team. During Harvard's first game of the 2017 season, Ben suffered a catastrophic cervical neck injury and was paralyzed. What started as a beautiful fall day ended in tragedy for Ben and his family.

&gt;* Facing a lifelong struggle, Ben has worked incredibly hard over the last two years to build his life anew. Remarkably, in August less than two years after his injury, Ben came back to Harvard University and started his freshman year again. Let's let Ben and his family know that the Harvard Square and the Harvard University community continue to support his valiant efforts. Let’s make this 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Day even bigger and better than the first two! There are several ways to help:

&gt;* Come eat at El Jefe’s (83 Mount Auburn Street) on * Tuesday, December 10th from 8 am until 4 am. Every penny that comes in the door that day will go to Ben’s fund. Spread the word and bring your friends! Customers will also be given the opportunity to add additional monies upon check out.

&gt;*  you are unable to eat at the restaurant on the 10th, representatives from the Varsity Club and the Harvard Football Team will be onsite all day collecting credit card and cash donations.

&gt;* Donate online: harvardvarsityclub.org/abercrombiefund

&gt;We encourage you to share this information in order to make this our biggest fundraising total yet! Come by on Tuesday and say hi to Ben. He'll be on site for most of the day.","El Jefe's &amp; Harvard Varsity Club announce 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Fundraiser on Tuesday, 10 December",t3_e71vk0,13.0,1.0

Ambitious/ridiculous, I know. Shoot for the stars they say.

My question is:
1) this is a feasible path?
2) there are lots of courses there for “math for teaching” is it too rudimentary/irrelevant?

—————

Edit: 
The Masters is “mathematics for teaching”. Not something I’m too keen on.

Which is why I was looking at the Bachelors to major in mathematics and wondering if the [math courses from HES](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses?subjects=Mathematics%2BApplied%20Mathematics)  available is sufficient/gives me a chance at pursuing a PhD?","Harvard extension school(HES) mathematics major, computer science minor",t3_dra2z9,4.0,0.7

&gt;	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no one’s surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

&gt;	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn’t really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

Harvard, from an academic standpoint, is very reputable and prestigious; they rank at the top in “best college” lists and things like that.

I was just wondering if there were any general trends/personality traits that stuck out to you that you might be able to characterize the students by. I had heard from a few friends who attend/had attended Harvard that a lot of people can be fake and that it is hard to make friends; is that true? Are there any other “traits” that could generally characterize this student body?

I was recently looking into Harvard University's Extension School and after chatting with one of the school's academic advisors, I still came away with a few questions that perhaps some of you may have the answers to. I suppose the easiest way to do this is to bullet-point them, so here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

* For the ""Earn-Your-Way-In"" admissions, I was thinking of taking the three suggested courses that are on the Extension School's website (EXPO 15, EXPO 25, and MATH E-3). The advisor I spoke to mentioned that they would count towards the degree itself. Any thoughts on this? How were the courses themselves?
* I noticed that there's an on-campus requirement. How was this for folks? Was it a pain trying to find parking/getting a parking pass from the university? (I live about an hour north of Cambridge in Maine)
* How were the online classes/courses? I'm no stranger to online learning, but I do know that every school has their own ""spin"" when it comes to online education.
* How's financial aid for the Extension School? I noticed that it was mentioned online, and briefly said by the advisor I spoke with, but is it generous (if needed, I would only be taking sixty-four credits for the degree, as I will have sixty-four credits transferring into the program itself; also, I currently have a 3.67 GPA, if that goes into academic scholarship decision-making).
* And lastly, for those of whom who have graduated from this program, is it worth it? I've read other comment sections/blogs/posts where some have had difficulties with their degrees, due to the phrasing of the degree itself (""Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies,"" even though they majored/concentrated in Environmental Studies), and was just wondering if there was any sort of ""stigma"" attached to the degree, or if the majority of what I read was just a bunch of hot air.
