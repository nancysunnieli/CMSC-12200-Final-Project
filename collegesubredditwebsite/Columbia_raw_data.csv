I  was recently accepted into one of Columbia's PhD programs and was wondering if any current grads could give me any advice on how livable the stipend is. I received the (standard) 33k 10-month stipend with health insurance. I have never lived in a city before in my life; what kinds of living expenses should I be factoring in? Will I need to purchase the monthly subway passes? Is rent affordable in the morningside heights area or will I be living in brooklyn/the bronx and biking/subway-riding in every day?

0.0,1612377521.0,240.0,columbia,"Wed, Feb 3 ‚Äî SEAS Students across campus let out a collective sigh of relief late last Tuesday as Ivy Elkins announced that, after nearly a decade of research, she had finally demystified the PhD. 

Chad, CC ‚Äô24, who hopes to work at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, or maybe Google one day, said that his unique aspirations make this news mostly irrelevant. ‚ÄúA what?‚Äù he asked, before opening gmail to update his spam filters. Chad currently has a B in Data Structures and could not be reached for further comment.

Speaking with reporters at a press conference on the condition of anonymity, Elkins noted that their work is far from over ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at you, dissertation,‚Äù she exclaimed around halfway through, to audible moans. When asked about fringe topics, such as how students are supposed to graduate if they can‚Äôt even get off waitlists, and how the university plans to keep 5,000 individuals safe in the middle of a pandemic, Elkins explained that she was ""not at liberty to demystify those,"" and referred people back to Bollinger's latest word salad.

Speaking to our reporters later in the evening, Lucas, SEAS '23, explained that he was overjoyed at the news. ""Every time I would get those emails I would wonder, has the PhD been demystified yet? I was starting to get worried. This is f*king huge"". 

A second student, William Cortez, noted the very personal effect this has had on his life. ""I always thought I wanted to study theater, become an actor, and follow my dreams, but after the forty fifth 'Happening now!!!' follow-up email I decided to get a PhD in Combinatorial Differential Geometry. I hope more students can see the light"".",[BREAKING] Ivy Elkins announces she has finally demystified the PhD,t3_lbunpu,240.0,0.97,demtogod

I work a very stressful job that typically involves ten or twelve hr shifts. I have pursued alternative avenues of work, after that was suggested multiple times. 1. pushing a problem onto me.

I am going to go into specifics apart from that.

&amp;#x200B;

But when I started looking at classes last semester at GS, I saw this very strange thing.

Most classes are one or two hrs three or four times a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that this is fine, I'll do the homework before everyone else.

But now I'm finding teachers expect us to be studying over the weekend. I know that's fair, but I believe it surfaces this reality that GS students are kind of jamf%$$ed into the schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to now each week write a letter explaining my circumstances, and I feel almost like a criminal having to explain myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been making me very depressed this semester, as I finished my assignment due on Thursday for UW on Tuesday, but I still have hw and a quiz for French on Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand why the onus is put on me to explain this, when their should be college-wide rhetoric that prefaces GS students and the challenges they face. I shouldn't be made to feel like an impostor by needing to ask for concessions at the outset.

&amp;#x200B;

The depression is getting worse as I care about my grades but I'm beginning to realize I am not in control. I do not have time to study sufficiently. I used to study biology notes at 3am on the train back in flashcards, but I am finding that harder to do. 

So come each successive Monday I will do bad on my quizzes as I will have had only a half a day to study, and my compositions will be late.

&amp;#x200B;

My teachers will continue to complain that my essays seem unpolished or rushed.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh well. It's time to start accepting the people that do well are the ones whose parents pay for their room and board, their clothing, their food, their tutors: these people will do better than me, and there is nothing in my power to go against that.

0.0,1611711212.0,9.0,columbia,"So I have posted about this a few times but I am honestly confused as to what I am missing. So I took a 1 credit dance class during the B block this past semester (mind you this is my third gym class I've taken so I didn't need it to graduate.) Unfortunately I dealt with serious medical issues that made it almost impossible for me to go. My professor was aware of this and said it was fine as long as I kept up with the dance recordings. My advisor was also aware and during this semester disabilities gave me extra accommodation in all my classes due to my medical issues. Long story short, my dance professor informed me after the dance class ended that there was a ""confusion"" with my attendance and that she could not pass me. I immediately spoke to my advisor who told me that due to circumstances the best thing to do is petition the committee for a late withdrawal. She even encouraged me to ask for a full refund. While petitioning the committee I submitted medical documentation from my Neurologist as well as Columbia Health services I also had email correspondences between my disability advisor as well as my professor where she okay'd me for missing class. 

Today I was notified that the committee denied me and I am a bit befuddled. I asked my advisor why and she said that it was because my narrative did not line up and she told me to submit medical documentation and emails between my professor and me. I did all of that a month ago, what else was I supposed to submit? 

I will be appealing the decision as well as speaking to OMBUDs. But, as an outsiders perspective why do you think they would deny me when I literally provided them with such a strong paper trail, medical documentation and emails from my professor? 

Do you think I could also try repetitioning the committee to change the point average? I know that I could have taken this class for 0 credits.

EDIT: As people have pointed out there has been a lot of lack of communication with this petition. For example when my advisor emailed me with my denial she said I needed to provide medical documentation. I politely informed her I already sent her a neurologist note, doctors note as well as disability accommodation. I also said Iwould be happy to provide more personal info (such as I am currently on anti seizure medication for my illness) even though it‚Äôs super personal. and she responded ‚Äúoh sorry I forgot you sent it in‚Äù",Tell me what I am missing with my CAS petition denial.,t3_l5t4ph,9.0,1.0,veggidumpling

I recently just submitted my application to Columbia GS for an early action decision.

At this time I have been unsuccessful in obtaining my HS transcripts because the school I attended is currently under a cyber attack and has been since last Nov. Apparently, a hacker hacked into the system and locked all county schools out of their records. (I know this sounds insane but it's true) Multiple reps I spoke to while trying to get ahold of the records said it is impossible at this time and to continue to check back bi-weekly to see if anything changes. I've also read multiple reports that my transcripts could also be unrecoverable.

I have reached out to GS via email and phone but have only been successful via email. I've tried to explain this to a counselor but kinda got a bland response and said they need to have my transcripts or else they will push my application back..but like lady, I can't get it...unless I pay the ransom to the hacker (YES I KNOW THIS SOUNDS F#%\*NG CRAZY).... so I responded back trying to be more clear and have not heard back. I am super concerned that this will count against me.

As of now they only have my essay, recommendation letters, resume, photo, and extracurricular to go off. I did 1 semester at a state school like 7 years ago but I didn't send those transcripts since I hardly counted it was going to start over anyway. (I think I took maybe 2 classes) My SAT scores were waived.

Should I try to get ahold of those transcripts anyway since I can't get my high school ones?

I gave them my diploma as well..

0.0,1610492000.0,5.0,columbia,"So I get my new issue of Columbia (Winter 20/21) and took a look at the letters. There was an article in the previous issue that was pretty lame, actually, along the lines of ""why can't we get along"" with the Red/Blue divide. I skimmed it, but thought I'd look at the letters it engendered. Okay, the usual... wouldn't it be nice if we could get along, we can't possible get along... that kind of thing.

Then I get to a quite long letter from the Right flank, from a certain Kenin Spivak, from my school and my year (CC77). He also got business and law degrees at the same time! Very impressive. Also, his address is Beverly Hills, and I rather doubt we're talking about the flats of Beverly Hills (i.e., the cheap part) or a Beverly Hills post office box. I expect we're talking about the Good Parts. 

I wondered if I ever met him. I was a Physics major and never had the most impressive work ethic, so I'm sure I never hung out with a driven, ambitious pre-law student. I doubt he was in the Columbia Players or Barnard Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, which was my social circle.

What struck me is his many references to anarchists; he says it 4 or 5 times. Anarchists who want to destroy the nuclear family. Anarchists who seek the violent overthrow of the government (ironic, now). Anarchists who oppose Democracy (also kind of ironic at this point). Anarchists who are appeased by the Democrats, so Democrats become terrorists-by-proxy, of course.

I'm looking around and thinking, Anarchists? Really? Where? Terrifying!

I see he also goes on about the threat of cancel culture, which ""...directly threaten(s) the safety and welfare of nearly every American."" I think he should really have a chat with Ross Douthat, a fellow (not to me, to Spivak) conservative, who wrote a really cogent editorial about cancel culture. I recommend it. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/opinion/cancel-culture-.html

Spivak sounds batty to me, and I really have to wonder about the specter of these unnamed anarchists. Like many, primarily on the Right, he seems to have created a Fantasy Enemy. This Enemy's existence is vital, because it allows Spivak to vote to, say, lower his own taxes and regulations on his business, but feel like he's voting to Save Civilization. Much more satisfying!

Does anyone know this guy? I assume he's alright, since he's in Beverly Hills and all... But maybe a family member should make sure he's eating right.","Smart guy, nutty letter in Columbia Magazine",t3_kw2wrj,5.0,0.73,pbasch

I'm in SEAS and I'm taking two time-consuming/difficult classes this semester. So I was deciding if I should just take 4 classes this semester to make sure I can do well in the courses and then take the 5th one during the summer A term. (This would just be for this semester, not in the future) However, I'm still not sure what internship I'm doing so if the dates collide with the summer A term, I wont be taking the 5th class then.

I was just wondering, is it common for SEAS students to take 4 classes instead of 5 for a semester? I don't want to take less than recommended number of classes but at the same time I want to make sure the workload is manageable so I can do well.

The two primary arguments posed in the email are that the university has ""$974 million in cash on hand"" and ""over $7.267 billion"" in completely unrestricted net assets from donors.

First of all, the balance sheet category of ""Cash and cash equivalents"" does not mean ""cash on hand"". The $974 million is in cash and cash equivalents which simply means that the money is in short-term securities that can be liquidated into cash within 1 year. Although this category doesn't break down exactly what sort of securities they're invested in or how they're treating them, it hasn't even been a year since the pandemic really started. Yes, they could have liquidated most of it but I just want to be aware of the fact that the phrase, ""cash on hand"", is incorrect. 

Second, the $7.267 billion in unrestricted net assets from donors has about 50% of it already committed to the endowment by the board. I'm not sure when the board votes on this issue and they may have been able to stop some of it from going into the endowment with the pandemic in mind, but it might have also been too late for that. If that's the case, there is about $3.7bn left completely unrestricted. This is still a lot of money that could easily cover a 10% decrease in tuition. I just wanted to point out the specifics within this amount of money because I think the argument that all $7.267 billion of the assets are unrestricted is false.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're giving up after the first no, that's far too early. 

I got rejected during Bain's resume screening last year so I emailed the recruiter to pitch myself for the role.

Here's how:

1. I found the recruiter's email on Bain's website.

2. I emailed her the following message:

\~

Hi \[recruiter name\],

I did not hear back yesterday but wanted to personally reach out anyway to express my interest in the San Francisco office. I believe I'd be a good fit because my extensive background in either technology or strategy roles. Most recently, I was a product strategy intern at Atrium, where I identified the biggest pains in the client experience, contributing to 80% of churn, and worked cross-functionally with teams to brainstorm strategic opportunities to tackle these pains.

If any vacancies open up on the 20th, I would love to be considered for a first round.

Thank you so much for your consideration,

Kareem

\~

It worked. She advanced me to the interview stage. [Proof](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6736754043122663424/) (photo with recruiter's response):

Bain didn't end up working out, but I used a similar technique with McKinsey and eventually landed a full-time offer.

0.0,1608691121.0,4.0,columbia,"Hello, Columbia!

Today I ask you your thoughts on an MBA from Columbia. 

To give background info, I‚Äôm a Sophomore at UMaine and I would love to go to Columbia University to do my masters degree in business management. I reached out to admissions and they gave me some answers, but nothing too crazy. I was wondering if anyone could fill me in on some details.

1.) Is the cost justified?

Given Columbia‚Äôs obvious academic accreditation,     does an MBA there justify the expense? Would I be better off getting a masters elsewhere? 

2.) Why Columbia?

I‚Äôve read countless posts from the other Ivy‚Äôs, and some of them seem to have an obsession with either hating on or hating Harvard. Some ‚ÄúColumbi‚Äù stray away from this norm and say that Columbia is the most toxic Ivy, while others say it was their third or fifth choice. What made Columbia the place for you?

3.) Better Acceptance Rate for Masters?

I also asked this question of admissions and they weren‚Äôt able to fully answer my question, citing that they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt speak specifically for undergraduate admissions, as I believe the requirements for different from ours in the MBA program. The review process for the NBA program at Columbia business course is holistic.‚Äù Someone gave an over simplification and said that with undergrad, they were more particular, and with graduate, it‚Äôs more a matter of ‚Äúgive us money and we‚Äôll take you.‚Äù I think they might‚Äôve had a bias against Bollinger, though. So, does anyone know?

4.) Campus living for Masters?

Short and simple: what‚Äôs it like and what are some pros/cons?

5.) Is It Worth It?

Putting aside all the above points, this is what matters most to me: is it worth it? If you could do it all again, would you go to Columbia for your education or go somewhere else? Any regrets or opportunities that you faced that only Columbia could‚Äôve given you? How has Columbia shaped you as a person and impacted your life?

**TL;DR: I got myself \~30+ interviews doing this and it takes an hour to set up (once your resume / background is pitched right).**

**Step 1:**

I use [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) Pro‚Äôs company search feature to get a list of companies I‚Äôm interested in and their relevant contact emails. I use the filter feature to filter for US based companies that fit the industry, company stage, etc. that I‚Äôm looking for.

**Step 2:**

I export the list from Crunchbase and input it into Hunter.io‚Äôs [bulk email verification](https://hunter.io/bulks/email-verifier?via=link) tool. This validates that all the emails are legitimate.

**Step 3:**

I then import the verified list into Hunter.io‚Äôs email [campaign sender](https://hunter.io/cold-email-campaigns?via=link) tool. This allows you to send semi-personalized emails to thousands of people at once.

**Step 4:**

I then write a cold email explaining who I am &amp; link my background.

**Step 5:**

I then run the email campaign. One of my email campaigns had a 24% response rate and led to \~30 interviews.

The email you write and how you tell your story determines your results! It‚Äôs the difference between no replies and a 24% response rate.

If you want to see this process explained with pictures (and see an example of an email reply I got) feel free to check that out this thread: [https://twitter.com/KareemAbukhadra/status/1328067835323625478](https://twitter.com/KareemAbukhadra/status/1328067835323625478)

I'm doing an MA program there and find myself constantly at odds reconciling the cost and ""prestige"" of this school with the actual academic experience it delivers. I've had professors insist on things that are obviously factually wrong, the vast majority of content in most of my classes has been dinky group projects for which most people immediately abandon any sense of responsibility, and it seems like the main qualification for entry is reasonable comprehension of the English language and a willingness to shell out considerable amounts of money. It wasn't until my 8th class (i.e. $35,000 in) that I actually felt like I learned something.   


I'm hoping this is a program-specific complaint and that other people aren't as unnerved by the product they've been sold at such a high markup, but even the two breadth courses I've taken from other departments have been shockingly low quality. So I guess if you're reading this and can commiserate, maybe this would be a good space to vent.

I applied to Columbia early decision this year because it was my dream school. Yesterday, I found out I got in! My family and I were so happy and excited, knowing that all my work had paid off.

Then, earlier this morning, I got an email from Columbia about our financial aid package. The school declared that I was not eligible for financial aid, meaning I had to pay around $80,000 my freshman year. I was so confused because my family is middle to upper middle class, meaning that we should get some form of financial aid. I was also ineligible for subsidized AND non subsidized loans from the government. This makes no sense! But I checked my FAFSA papers over and over and there is no mistake! I turned in all of the necessary paperwork to Columbia before the deadline. The Columbia price calculator and what FAFSA said I should be able to afford were from $10,000 to $25,000. 

I'm just so confused and scared now! I thought the hardest part was past me and that I could go to my dream school, but now I don't know what will happen! I already signed up for a virtual meeting, sent them an email, and appealed the decision, but the anticipation is killing me already. 

Do y'all think that this was a mistake by the financial aid office or with something I didn't turn in? Is this normal? Do you think I will be able to overturn the decision with an appeal? I just need help to understand what is going on.

I‚Äôm on a gap year due to COVID but have a place at Columbia which I deferred. 

I know for a fact that I want to study film. It‚Äôs my passion and part of the reason I applied to the US and Columbia in particular (I‚Äôm a UK student). However, I‚Äôm also greatly passionate about philosophy and would love to get a degree in it also if possible, mainly to keep some other doors open. 

So how hard is it to double major in these two subjects and would you recommend it? I know it‚Äôs harder for some subjects and easier for others. I also know the core has an emphasis on philosophy anyway but obviously you don‚Äôt get a degree in the core lol. I just don‚Äôt want to have no time to pursue other things by double majoring but my understanding is that these two aren‚Äôt as time consuming as other subjects.

I‚Äôm currently in a 3000 level English class that‚Äôs lecture style with discussion sections led by grad students. They also grade our papers and determine our grade. 

So my first paper didn‚Äôt go too well (I got a B). I knew that paper wasn‚Äôt my best so I buckled down for the second one and even called in my friend (who‚Äôs a great essay writer and constantly gets A‚Äôs on his essays) to give me feedback, and I got a B again. Now this was confusing to me because I know I‚Äôm not the best writer, but I also know that essay was much better than the previous one. I texted a girl who I met in that class and asked her if she was satisfied with her essay grades and she was in the same boat as me. We texted two other people from the class and apparently they are also having issues with her incredibly harsh grading on a 4 page limit paper.

So now I‚Äôm wondering how to go about addressing her grading. Should I meet with the lecture professor or should we come together and request a meeting with her? I did email her with my concerns about the essay grades and my grade in the class to which she replied that the grade is a average of all our papers plus participation and I am a active participant. The part that confused me was when she said, ‚Äúthe B+ range is already above average.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to make of it, so here I am on Reddit instead.

It seems that I have to stop attending. So I can't focus on class.

I met with financial aide and my disability coordinators and it seems they want me to focus on continuing in restaurants.

I left out in my entry admission how much I dislike cooking, and the negative effects it has had on me.

I'll write the least offensive ones here: PTSD, sexual assault, anorexia, homelessness. 

I'm not good at math due to my learning disability. I know somethings. If you add all of those up what do you think you get?

Apparently I made a large mistake in pursuing an education in something not very practical. 

So now I'm being advised to focus more on a lifelong career in cooking. To meet with my career advisor to discuss this as an option.

I knew something was wrong as I was starting to feel almost happy. I felt like years and years of failure were adding up into something that could give a value to so much time I wasted trying to survive.

So I have autism, and I'm trans. I stopped focusing on that to focus on school.

 I hate any sort of masculinity a lot. I hate that culture of work the most so I try to keep quiet. School allowed me to speak, and of course I wasn't that good as I had never had that.

I am just realizing now that, as I can't take out more loans to continue, I will be hit with the loans I have. As it is I was deeply poor while living on my own. So I will be even worse for trying at all.

I have to find a full-time job that pays way above minimum which is standard, and then I have to work probably five days. Just to enable me to take out private loans. I have met a lot of successful people who never had to fight so hard to get loans when they went to school. Columbia doesn't have classes that really work with a five day work week.

I'm going to have to suffer for the rest of my life for trying at all. 

I just want people to be aware of this potential reality. I had been living in fear for so long, that I became unable to think about the future and the past without breaking down.

I would take everything day by day. And now I'm hit with the reality of that.

I'm incredibly tired. I'm fine.

The following message will be sent to the larger Columbia community shortly.  You, especially, will understand the many qualities that make Dean Boyce ideal for this position, including her deep commitment to SEAS and to Columbia.  The School of Engineering and Applied Science is a very special place, a testament to its faculty, staff, and students, and with many important and productive partnerships across the University.  It has been enriched by Mary‚Äôs deanship and the University will now benefit from her strong leadership in this new role.  I will share plans for a dean search in the new year.  In the meantime, please join me in congratulating Dean Boyce.

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I write today, with great happiness, to announce my appointment of Mary C. Boyce, presently Dean of The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, as the next Provost of the University. We are, indeed, fortunate to have someone with Dean Boyce‚Äôs combination of administrative capacity, academic accomplishment, and deep knowledge of Columbia to assume this role, which is always critical to the University‚Äôs future but is especially so at this remarkable moment. Mary will officially take over as Provost on July 1, 2021. Ira Katznelson, who has been both gracious and enormously effective as Interim Provost, during a time of challenges both unforeseeable and monumental, has generously agreed to continue on until July.

Mary‚Äôs service as Dean these past seven years has been exemplary. The School has thrived, buoyed by her celebration of intellectual creativity in all its forms, by her thoughtful expansion of the School‚Äôs academic programming, and by the recruitment of top scholars from around the world to the Engineering faculty. Propelled by a firm belief in the value of interdisciplinary work, Mary has led in establishing connections among Columbia Engineering and other parts of the University. Due to her determined efforts, we now have more faculty working together in areas such as Data Science, Nano Science, Sensing and Imaging, Sustainability, and Engineering in Medicine. Dean Boyce has brought Columbia Engineering‚Äôs expertise to the world, perhaps most notably by organizing Columbia faculty to help resolve an engineering bottleneck that was threatening the reconstruction of the L train subway tunnel with cost and time overruns. And Mary has made a special effort to advance the cross-disciplinary and creative opportunities available to undergraduate and graduate students through new spaces, new design and research programming, and new curricular and co-curricular offerings.

Mary has also been influential in her contributions to the University at large. She has been an important advisor on virtually every one of the many new initiatives we have set forth over the past several years. And her distinguished service on important search committees for key University appointments has broadened her knowledge of the institution and provided wise counsel when it was needed.

Dean Boyce is Columbia‚Äôs Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor of Engineering. When she arrived at Columbia in 2013 to lead the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Mary had been on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for 25 years, a period during which her research in the area of materials and mechanics led to innovative hybrid material design and earned broad respect across the field. Dean Boyce is a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Engineering. She earned her BS degree in Engineering Science and Mechanics from Virginia Tech, and her MS and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from MIT.

In short, Mary is an accomplished scholar, an effective leader, and a consummate University citizen. I am delighted she has agreed to serve as Provost and look forward to working even more closely with her in the years to come. I will write soon about a search for Mary‚Äôs successor and interim leadership at The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. But now, we celebrate our good luck in having Mary‚Äôs many talents dedicated to the advancement of Columbia.

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger

Email from Dean Boyce:

Dear Columbia Engineering Students,

Today, President Bollinger issued an official announcement of my appointment as the new Provost of the University, effective July 1, 2021. I am honored, humbled, and excited to be taking on this new role within Columbia.

It has been such an honor to serve as your dean. You know my passion for engineering and my passion for propelling students during such an important and pivotal time in your lives. Our student body is at the core of the greatness of Columbia Engineering and of Columbia University. Your enthusiasm, talent, and creativity have been an inspiration and a spur to do all I can to strengthen Columbia Engineering and further raise its level of impact. As you have heard me say many times, engineering is in a renaissance and now considered to be a foundational degree that empowers our students to succeed in whatever field they choose. Our vision to be Columbia Engineers for Humanity continues and I intend to play a role in helping to advance this vision from my new vantage point as Provost at Columbia.

As we near the end of one term and prepare for another, I want to thank you again for your resilience and spirit. You demonstrate time and again that despite our remoteness, we are part of one Columbia community.

President Bollinger‚Äôs announcement follows below.

If not, does anyone have suggestions of other CS electives that don't have strict prereqs and are generally interesting?

I asked for a recommendation for a private loan provider and they told me they sign a document stating they cannot recommend any.

I found that a bit suspect as they necessitate the loans. 

I asked on r/StudentLoans for a recommendation and they told me asking that much for a bachelors is not advisable so they also wouldn't help me.

My background is as follows:

Political Science major, French minor from a decent state school in Texas, graduated December 2019. Completed Associate's at a local community college before transferring to my University on a full ride scholarship through a private scholarship foundation for select state schools.

LOR: 1 from my thesis advisor and former prof, 1 from previous internships and potentially from community college profs. Will also probably get one from my corps manager when my contract ends. 

GPA: 3.8; this is cumulative from total college career

Undergrad info:

‚Ä¢Active in honors and Phi Theta Kappa while at community college, held leadership roles and attended conferences for Phi Theta Kappa. Also volunteered as a debate coach for a local high school club.

‚Ä¢At University, did Model UN briefly, founded a human trafficking awareness student organization, wrote undergrad thesis with IRB approved research and presented at a conference. 

‚Ä¢Also did a semester abroad in France taking intensive French language courses 

Internships: 1 with local anti-trafficking organization, then at the George W Bush Presidential Center as a research and evaluation intern, spent about 7 months here. 

Currently, I am completing a service year through AmeriCorps in the NYC area.

I spent some time working and life kept happening so I put off going back to school until I landed a government job. I was able to go back to school and almost got all. As but did badly in one semester due to the pandemic and all the overtime I had to do, so my GPA is in the low 3s, before that it was a 4.0.

I never took Mowsh bio and I feel like i might do poorly in Danny's class. anyone have any tips on how i could do well in danny's class? is there something i should study in advance? im a senior so its my last semester to take biochem.",Biochem Tips,t3_k0z5mz,2.0,1.0,MangoLover94705797

I just got an e-mail about a hearing with the dean and I was wondering if y'all have any advice. It's a first time offence and I feel like shit about it. I'm hoping for just a warning or conditional probation but is that unrealistic? Is there anything I can do besides honesty and apology for the best outcome?,Disciplinary Hearing,t3_k0w4q6,14.0,1.0,columbiathrow1000

As you know, rates are going up. We‚Äôre doing a pretty good job but we‚Äôre going to tighten it down just a bit. Please don‚Äôt be like those idiots at the Business School. We‚Äôd definitely kick them out if it wasn‚Äôt for their generous tuition donations each year. 

As you have heard, there is a vaccine coming. We are doing our best to make sure we secure enough for Columbia. We‚Äôre definitely making this mandatory. For any of you idiots dumb enough to travel home to your family at this time...we will be watching (spooky music here).

We‚Äôre figuring out classes, so wait for another email letting you know to wait some more about hybrid and in-person instruction.

I‚Äôm off to make a stiff drink.

Cheers,

However, I am also terrified that I do not remember enough from orgo and do not want to kill my GPA. For next semester, there are two professors teaching biochemistry (Ho is teaching UN3300 and Stockwell is teaching UN 3511)

Does anyone have any suggestions on which class to take/insights on either professor?

I thought the whole point was that even a core/major req could also be pass failed. for reference the courses that were marked as no p/d/f were numerical methods (apma 4300) and physics 2601. anyone have any idea why this might be? has ssol just not been appropriately updated yet?",the SEAS p/d/f policy,t3_k0hb9i,3.0,1.0,city-living2468
