0.0,1612387965.0,0.0,princeton,"Hi all,

Princeton has long been my dream school (more precisely, since sophomore year). You will see this reflected in the breakdown of my performance. 

I have a few LD‚Äôs, such as a bad case of ADHD and NVLD. I attended a special needs middle school and now attend a small prep school in NYC. Freshman year was challenging, as I was behind on the material and had anxiety from the greater expectations. I caught up over that summer, and perhaps fortuitously visited Princeton then too. I thought it impossible to ever attend, given my poor academic career. Nonetheless, I was inspired by the campus and kept it in mind. I worked diligently in sophomore year, saw significant improvement, and continue to now as a junior. 

One of my concerns lies in the fact that I never enrolled in an AP course. My school offers five across sophomore, junior, and senior years. In sophomore year, I had no chance of enrolling in one given my class trajectory. I applied for them this year, but didn‚Äôt get admitted. I was, however, enrolled in two honors courses for the first time. I plan on taking two APs and at least two honors next year as well. Could this ‚ÄúAP‚Äù dilemma be explained away, or will it irreparably damage my application? 

I have also heard that Princeton doesn‚Äôt consider freshman grades, but they are listed below in case that isn‚Äôt true - and for context. 

Anyway, here are my grades, **potential** test scores, extracurriculars, and awards across my three years of high school.


Intended major: Literature

*My school uses the 100 scale for GPA. I will make conversions to the 4.0 scale. 

- 9th grade: 81 GPA (2.7)
- 10th grade: 95 GPA (4.0)
- 11th grade (thus far): 95 GPA (4.0)

Class rank: 19/65 (brought down by 9th grade, would likely be top 10 without it) 

I will be taking the August SAT. My goal is a 1500+, and I intend to spend my breaks and summer studying. I have a private tutor and ample resources to realize this goal. In the event that I don‚Äôt, I may go test-optional. 

Current extracurriculars: 

- President and founder of Debate Society
- Editor of and contributor to school literary magazine
- Publisher for school newsletter
- Peer tutor
- Member of history tournament team

Planned additions:

- Debate Society competing in tournament
- Receiving recognition outside of school for literary works (publishing newspaper in local publication, submitting poetry online). 
- Delivering speeches at venues (likely virtual) over summer or in fall

It‚Äôs a simple list, I know - but these are the things I chose to do out of genuine passion. I‚Äôve heard that less is more when it comes to EC‚Äôs, but please be the judge of that. 

Current awards:

- Deans List for two consecutive years
- Spanish department award (10th grade)
- Science department award (10th grade)

Projected additions: 

- At least two more department awards
- Awards for school extracurriculars (Debate Society tournament, school literary magazine, newsletter)

I don‚Äôt believe anyone from my school has been admitted to Princeton - or at least not for many years, but all other Ivies (with the exception of Dartmouth) and other top schools regularly take students from here. It may be because they don‚Äôt apply to Princeton (I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone doing so). 

I realize a lot of this is hypothetical. But if I do realize these academic goals, would I have a chance at Princeton? I intend to apply restrictive E.A. so they know how strong and personal this desire is. 

Thank you all!",I yearn to be a tiger - but is it possible?,t3_lbywtx,0.0,0.36

I am not particularly hell-bent on getting all As, but I am currently failing two classes and am on the verge of failing another. I am pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADHD/executive function disorder, and I am going currently untreated for GAD. I seem to start assignments and cannot continue studying for more than 10 minutes at a time, after that I begin actively seeking distractions (napping, online browsing, cooking, chores etc). Additionally, I struggle to remember quantitative material, which makes my STEM courses particularly difficult to understand as most derivations are initially too difficult for me to understand. I think I would be able to focus or pass my classes if I maybe had one or two classes with no precepts or labs. 

What i've currently been doing to minimize my burnout has not been working. I stay in regular contact with my DSL, but I do not interact in any with my RCA or PAA as I genuinely do not enjoy my previous interactions with them or my advisory groups. I have been looking for a therapist to for my GAD for the past 8 weeks and I do not have my first appointment with them until after midterms. I am increasing the amount of times I go to office hours, but I notice for some of my classes that I do not have questions for my professors during office hours because they went over the material I am lost on over a week ago.

I find it difficult to study regularly throughout the week, either I will spend 7+ hours of pomodoro method studying or I will do nothing all day. 

Has anyone else struggled this much with online learning, and is their anything I can do to  get my grades under control now? This current way of studying is unsustainable, and I am not of privilege to be able to take a gap year or defer in the future.

0.0,1595316592.0,2.0,princeton,"Hi! I‚Äôm an UCI research assistant and I was assigned the task of understanding how major selection works in a few top colleges, one of which includes Princeton. I was wondering if you guys could help me out with a few of your opinions; it definitely doesn‚Äôt have to be objective, I‚Äôm grateful for all the information, however subjective, I can collect. I've already perused the website and statements by admission officers, but I wanted to hear from actual students, so educated guesses (or even speculation) are all appreciated!

So, here are the questions:

1. Does Princeton require you to input an intended major on your application? Can you put undeclared?
2. If Princeton does require an intended major, after you‚Äôre accepted to Princeton with that intended major, does Princeton expect you to follow through? For instance, if a student picked ‚ÄúComputer Science,‚Äù will Princeton funnel that student into an engineering department and expect him/her to take engineering courses and activities, or does Princeton really treat everyone the same way no matter what they picked for intended major (at least until they declare)? Is there a limiting of options in regards to classes, activities, etc. for certain majors, even unintentionally?
3. I saw that there was a deadline difference between A.B. and B.S.E degrees, with B.S.E degrees having an earlier declared major deadline. Do you think this affects major selection/major changes (or generally anything about majors) in any way?
4. When does Princeton expect students to declare their majors by? Can a student be truly ‚ÄúUndeclared‚Äù up until the point of declaring their majors?
5. And lastly, based on your opinion, does intended major affect admissions? A lot of colleges I‚Äôve looked into have stated publicly that the intended major does not affect admissions, but we also know diversity in ideologies (and thus major) is also important. This, of course, is a very touchy subject and I‚Äôm definitely not expecting the absolute, objective truth for this question; just wanted to hear your thoughts.

Other than these questions, if you have any other comments you could share about how students are pressured to take certain majors over others at Princeton, and any reason they would change their major: they would be appreciated!

These charges come at a crucial time during which students are completing Dean‚Äôs date assignments and studying for final exams. Under normal circumstances, this would be a very stressful situation, but considering the current state of affairs in the nation, it can be overwhelming for every student in the course.

An anonymous post was made on Tiger Confessions in which a person claiming to be a math PHD student and a TA for MAT 202 stated that the students had been baited by a professor. A quick look into Slader.com led to a contributor account with the user name ‚ÄúArthur Dent.‚Äù This particular account had posted only four solutions. All of the four solutions were for problems from the fifth edition of Linear Algebra with Applications by Otto Bretscher, the exact book used by MAT 202. Of those four solutions, one was in the assigned problems for problem set 9, and two were in the assigned problems from problem set 10. Specifically, 8.1 #23, 8.2 #37, and 8.2 #70. The time at which the solutions were posted was provided in a correspondence email with a content director at Slader after a request was made. The solutions were posted April of 2020. Problem set 9 was due April 27th. Problem set 10 was due the following week. Further inquiry to this account led to the Slader representative indicating that the email associated to the contributor account seemed to be fake. A separate correspondence with Slader stated ‚ÄúOur moderators have confirmed that the answers given by that user were nonsense but written to look like they were reasonable.‚Äù The solutions have since been removed, however screenshots were taken and have been linked to this post.

I am a student at Princeton, and I made the poll in the MAT 202 GroupMe chat. Though I knew most students would be hesitant to participate, even a small amount of information would help shed light on what is going on. Currently, the poll stands at 9 students who claim their charges relate to problem #23 from section 8.1, one student claims their charge relates to problem #37 from section 8.2, and zero students have selected ‚Äúnone of the above.‚Äù I am not writing this message to accuse any professor of entrapping their students, what I intend to do is bring to light some peculiar information about a situation which has already raised many red flags. Cheating is not right, it reflects poorly on one‚Äôs character and negatively impacts peers who put forth an honest effort. But as detrimental as cheating may be, entrapment is just as harmful and just as dishonorable.

# It‚Äôs been over six years since Princeton professor Imani Perry  called the police because I criticized her in a blog post. I have still  not been arrested. But she has! Ain‚Äôt karma¬†wonderful?

In July 2013, I wrote [this](https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/dr-imani-perry/) blog post where I criticized a section of [this](https://www.thehairpin.com/2013/07/teaching-trayvon/) article, which had been written by [Imani Perry](https://aas.princeton.edu/people/imani-perry), a professor of African-American Studies at Princeton University.

After I wrote that blog post, I wrote the following email to Dr. Perry:

*‚ÄúI welcome you to show this to your students and anyone else whom you think might like to read it and comment on it.‚Äù*

Dr. Perry responded to my email by writing the following email to me:

*‚ÄúI will be reporting you to the police for harassment.‚Äù*

Prior to this, I had thought that Ivy League universities only hired  professors who were interested in having discussions and debates over  topics with which they disagreed. It had never occurred to me that one  of them would call the police simply because someone disagreed with  something that they had said.

Which is why I was totally shocked to find out that Dr. Perry had called the police on me.

Well, it‚Äôs been more than six years since Dr. Perry called the police on me, and I still haven‚Äôt been arrested.

In the meantime, I recently did some googling to see what Dr. Perry has been up to.

And it turns out that Dr. Perry herself has been arrested!

It actually happened four years ago, but I just found out about it now.

In February 2016, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/us/police-release-video-of-traffic-stop-of-princeton-professor.html):

*The police in Princeton, N.J., released a dashboard video of the traffic stop of a black Princeton professor‚Ä¶*

*The video shows what appears to be a routine traffic stop with the professor, Imani Perry‚Ä¶ She was then arrested‚Ä¶*

*After pulling Dr. Perry over, the male officer told her he had clocked her driving at 67 miles per hour in a 45-m.p.h. zone‚Ä¶*

*Fifteen minutes elapsed before the officer returned to her car to tell Dr. Perry that her license had been suspended‚Ä¶*

*About two minutes later, the officer returned to tell her she had a warrant out for her arrest over a parking offense from 2013.*

The previous years we've had actress Ellie Kemper, senator Cory Booker, director Baz Luhrmann, and novelist Jodi Picoult; however, none of these speakers' accomplishments are comparable to the magnificent Snoop Dogg (aka Snoop Lion).

Snoop Dogg is an iconic rapper who has changed the culture of the hip hop throughout his dynamic career. Being nominated for over 17 Grammy's (should've won 17...), selling over 35 million albums worldwide, and making hits like ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" makes Snoop Dogg more than qualified to deliver a brilliant and evocative speech to the Princeton community.

**given this, i'd not assume and falsely imagine cultural  ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, or other made up ideas**

- since i dont believe in these made up ideas anymore, i cannot talk in a way that assumes these made up ideas to actually be scientific facts in life, since there is no evidence 

**ppl in many culture &amp; nations live their life without the assumptions of these ideas of agency, freedom, choice, self-determination, etc**

- so this indicates that living without these falsely imagined ideas is possible



**we also do not know if everything is causally deterministic, but if everything were, then we would be sure that there's no agency, choice, and freedom etc**

in physics, some things are causally deterministic, and some things arent

- see https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/d2dd4z/open_discussion_according_to_the_best_physicists/

likely more than 50% of all things are not causally deterministic, and that by itself doesnt mean that agency, choice, and freedom exist



**if there were such imagined things as   agency, choice, and freedom, then to what extent is this agency choice &amp; freedom limited or constrained?**

nobody knows but we know it's highly limited &amp; constrained 

- we have no idea if an action is 'intentional' or not, be that our own or actions of others 

- without knowing if something is  intentional, we have no idea if this action is based on our control or not


**not only do we not know the extent, but dont know the minimal requirements of having agency, etc**

&gt; Nonetheless, it falls short of giving us everything we have reason to expect from account of personal autonomy.

&gt; In particular, challenges to different approaches sketched above suggest that they do not spell out the minimal conditions under which person‚Äôs exercise of authority over how she behaves reflects her own power to determine how she exercises this authority.

&gt; Minimal self-state seems to require nothing more nor less than being power behind whatever reasoning directly gives rise to one‚Äôs behavior.
Yet none of the accounts we have canvassed here seems to capture this important, most basic, form of self-state.

- see https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/#ChalIdenMiniCondPersAuto

\- Do you think the new college will be built in a modern style or in collegiate gothic? Personally, I'm hoping for collegiate gothic because it would preserve the campus architecture better.

\- What are your general thoughts on expanding enrollment? Will this impact the legendary community that the university prides itself on?

I'm a high school junior and I'm interested in applying to Princeton next year. I just have one quick question for any current undergrads or alumni.

 Certain colleges \(e.g Dartmouth\) are known for being really tight\-kit while others \(e.g Columbia\) supposedly have a weaker sense of campus community. What is the community like at Princeton? Do you know a large percentage of your peers? Do people interact only with small social groups or is there campus\-wide community as well?

I visited Cornell and found it to be sort of massive and impersonal, while I loved Williams and Dartmouth. Where does Princeton fall on this spectrum? I know this is partially an issue of size but I'm particularly curious about the culture.

After careful research, I have concluded that this subreddit's banner color is not consistent with Princeton's color identity. In fact, it occupies some muddled ground in the color space between yellow, orange, gold, honey, tangerine, and carrot (see: [color shade names](https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/color-thesaurus-correct-names-of-shades/)).

According to the [Guide to Princeton University's Graphic Identity](http://trademrk.princeton.edu/secure/uisg/UniversitySG.pdf), ""Princeton Orange"" is defined as PMS 158, a spot color in the [Pantone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantone) Matching System color space. The Guide indicates that the hex equivalent to this color is [#ee7f2d](https://www.colorhexa.com/ee7f2d).

However, the [Office of Communications](https://communications.princeton.edu/guides-tools/logo-brand-assets) notes that PMS 158 is meant for use in print--paper, apparel, and sundries. On the web, Princeton uses [#e77500](https://www.colorhexa.com/e77500) on white backgrounds and [#f58025](https://www.colorhexa.com/f58025) on black backgrounds. Given the current formatting of this subreddit, the former seems to be the most appropriate choice.

Other considerations: The [2007 Princeton Athletics Identity Style Guide](http://trademrk.princeton.edu/secure/protected/AthleticsStyleGuide.pdf) defines ""Athletics Orange"" as PMS 165. However, like PMS 158, this is also meant for use in print. Additionally, ColorHexa refers to [#ff8f00](https://www.colorhexa.com/ff8f00) as Princeton Orange but this is inconsistent with the guidance provided in Princeton's own Guide to Graphic Identity.

I've tried reaching out to administrative staff and faculty, but so far all my emails/phonecalls to the department have been ignored. So I'll ask here.

0. **Does the department view Master's students as ""second-hand"" compared to the Ph.D. students?** There seem to be tons of resources for Ph.D. students (and Post-Docs), and I hear only good things about the program, but I've heard nothing about the perspective from a Master's program.

0. **Is research an option for Master's students?** I've been offered funding through a teaching assistantship, but I'm far more interested in research. The website seems to imply that research assistantship is reserved for Ph.D. and Post-Doc students.

0. **How social is the department?** I know this is a very broad and speculative question, but I'm generally interested in what kinds of events or social circles emerge within the department. For example, my current department has a very active social community in the grad program which plans picnics, movie showings, trivia nights, etc.

0. **What kind of resources are available to graduate students?** Another hard to answer question, but it's inspired by my current institution's strong student union. We have a student-run organization that is dedicated to advertising and fighting for TA and RA employment rights. I vaguely recall someone mentioning that the last time people at Princeton tried starting a union, the administration shut it down. I'm just looking for any comments related to this kind of resource.

0. **How is the political climate on/around campus?** I'm coming from a strongly liberal university located near a strongly conservative government institution. I appreciate the diversity of opinions in this area, and I love the many opportunities to be involved in political discussions.

0. **Anything else?** I'm happy to hear any comments about what life as a CS Master's student at Princeton might be like. It's a beautiful and old campus with a huge list of prominent alumni, but I want to know what to expect as an average student.

I'm fairly confident I'll complete this certificate, but as for the actual major/concentration I'm thinking of Math or Computer Science. I don't think I'll decide between those two anytime soon, but I definitely want to do the Stats.

Also, if I decide on Math and complete the stats certificate, is there room to take programming classes? I'm not sure if two certificates (Applications in Computing + Stats) would be feasible, but is it doable to study math/stats and also take a lot of programming classes?

I'm interested in learning more about graduate life at Princeton University for those who chose to pursue a Ph.D. in Operations Research. 

Regarding pre-requisites, what is the required background you must have? I know this varies from university to university, but some schools, like Columbia, require Real Analysis, a class Engineers usually don't take. If a student lacks knowledge on a particular area, does Princeton give the student some time to catch up? For someone whose undergraduate education was in Engineering, how much ""catching up"" in advanced mathematics is there to be done? 

How many classes are you obligated to take in your first year? What would you say about the workload? 

Research-wise, is there an area that attracts the interest of more professors and students, or a specific area the school is known for? (I'm really interested in the research carried out by the PENSA group). 

Finally, I know some schools will only accept students into their Ph.D. programs if they can fully fund the students. Is that the case for  Princeton?

&gt; encourage applications from students from low-income backgrounds, 
&gt; community college students, and U.S. military veterans. 

As a current freshman at USC (1570 SAT, 4.0 GPA), is it worth applying, or will admission essentially be out-of-reach even for relatively well-qualified applicants? (At Harvard, only 13 out of 1400 transfer applicants were accepted last year.) I feel I can demonstrate a passion for my program of interest, which is a blend of cognitive science and philosophy, speak to several aspects of the Princeton culture and campus which make a good fit, and generally make a good case for my admission. If chances are predicted to be near-zero though--especially as I fit into none of the above groups--I'll probably apply elsewhere.

The Turkish government has awarded him many grants to publish works denying that the massacres of ethnic Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks should be labeled as a genocide committed by the Turkish government.

I made a reservation for 6 people at 6:00 and 4 of us arrived on time while the other 2 would be arriving a few minutes late. We informed the front desk that we arrived and had a reservation. They looked up my name in the system and confirmed our reservation. They then proceeded to show other guests to tables and left us standing there. We had to go back over to them and ask that we be seated. This was very odd. 

When we got seated we had a wonderful waitress who was very engaging, but who mistakenly advised my whole party that the Sangria along with other ""concoctions"" and mixed drinks were included in the happy hour at the bar that was ending at 6:30. A few of us went up to the bar to order half price sangrias for the six of us. They poured each glass and set them in front of us and then gave us the check where we noticed they were not rung up for half price. We told the bartender and she informed us that they were not included in the happy hour. We explained that we had been explicitly told by our waitress that they were included and if they were not part of the happy hour then we didnt want them. The bartender called over the manager Chad who had earlier left us standing in the lobby waiting to be seated after confirming our party had arrived. He explained again that it wasnt part of the happy hour and that there was nothing he could do so we said we didnt want them. At this point the ""right"" thing to do was to have given us the sangrias at half price because now the poured drinks were just going to go to waste and they might as well get the $6 for them instead of being out the $12 for each glass.

BUT that was not the case because Chad told the bartender to pour the glasses of Sangria back into the large tub of sangria to be served again! Right in front of us the bartender told Chad that you are not allowed to do that but he replied with ""Yes I can"" and proceeded to scoop out the ice from each glass and pour all the sangria back into the serving container to be served again! If this is going on right in front of customers then what is going on behind the scenes at this restaurant!? You CANNOT serve something to a customer and then re-serve it to another!

I'm going to be a grad student at Pton in the fall, but I kind of wanted to gauge the culture before going so I knew what to expect. The place I did my undergrad in was located in a college-town where the 70s culture never really left. There are a lot of hippie-dippie leanings and the town is small, inclusive, and definitely focused on the arts/entertainment at large (outside of the university).

I know that Princeton is also a college-town, but I've heard that it's definitely more ""old money"" and Gatsby-esque in some ways. I've never really seen income disparity at my undergrad school, but I've heard that the spectrum is a little more visible at Princeton. Can anyone speak to this?

Also, I'm sure that there is definitely some aspect of fiscal conservatism at Princeton (I grew up a few towns over, I know what it's like), but is Princeton socially-liberal? I'm not expecting the same kind of hippie-freedom that my undergrad school's town had, but it would be comforting to know that Princeton culture isn't too judgmental. I know that art and entertainment play a big role in the culture there, too, but it feels more ""prestige-driven"", as it were, as opposed to art for arts sake? Idk how to explain it. Maybe if y'all came to where I go to undergrad you'd see what I meant, haha.

Anyway, please forgive me if I'm misinformed!

So I'm going to be a graduate student over at Pton next year, and I was wondering if I could ask a couple of questions about piano lessons on/near campus.

I've been playing continuously since 2005, but I never really cared much to practice until I started college and became more serious about what I did in my free time. Basically, I had formal lessons from 2005 until I left for college a few years ago, but I've been mostly just playing stuff by myself without any guidance for the last couple of years, since I go to school in a pretty remote location in upstate NY and it's hard to find people to teach piano here.

When I come back to civilization next year, I am hoping to actually have someone guide me so I don't develop bad posture/fingerings. Does anybody have recommendations for either teachers or places that I should look for around the Princeton area for a student like me with some experience already? Are teachers around the area usually only kid-focused?

1. I've been offered a stipend of just over $32,000 a year. Are graduate stipends taxable? If so, at what rate? Will the fact that I'm from the UK, which has a tax treaty with the US, have any effect on this?

2. I've been offered full health insurance by Princeton. What will this include? I have a pre-existing health condition (depression), for which I take medication. Will my insurance cover this and the cost of my medication, or will it be excluded? If it doesn't cover it, how much would a month's worth of citalopram hypobromide (20mg) cost?

I would like to know a bit more before making my final decision. I plan on visiting the campus in March during my spring break and seeing what it's like.

I was wondering if someone (preferably current or former MSE in CS students) could tell me more about this program. I have some more specific questions below about the thesis-track version of the program:

 * What are the research opportunities like? Is it easy to continue onto a PhD (at Princeton or elsewhere) from the MSE program? I am a pretty weak student coming out of undergrad in terms of research/GPA, so I'd like to use this opportunity to showcase improved academics and a better research portfolio when I apply to PhD programs in 2 years.

 * Are you required to do research between the end of your first year and the beginning of your second year? Or did you do a tech/fintech internship instead?

 * What kind of classes did you have to take? I went to another top-10 school for undergrad, so I think a lot of the classes may be of comparable quality (e.g. we have an equivalent of COS 326 at my undergrad school with some of the same assignments, like Moogle). So I feel like I would want to take classes that I haven't already done in undergrad. Did you get to take anything interesting, or was it mostly focused on your specialization within CS?

 * Can you combine disciplines? I'm interested at the intersection of PL and computer architecture (approximate computing and new hardware/software models to support the new paradigm). Is it easy to find advisors willing to work a little out of their comfort zones to accommodate unusual interests, or are people more traditional?

 * Where did you look for housing? As it happens, I grew up around the area, so I know about the happening areas (I used to frequent Hoagie Haven back in high school). My parents live in Kendall Park (which borders Princeton and is literally off of Route 27, about 10 minutes away). I could live with them, but the stipend makes it possible for me to live on/off-campus in an apartment or something. Do y'all have any recommendations?

 * Did you come to Princeton MSE from another undergrad or did you just continue from Princeton undergrad? If you're from somewhere else, can you talk about what it is like to adjust to the Princeton academic climate?

 * Are all the MSE students close? Did you find it easy to make friends/get involved despite being possibly new to the school? Do you feel like it's easy to have fun, or is it a lot more serious than undergrad?

So sorry about all the questions! I'm really excited, and I'd like to know more about the school.

I have pretty good grades in CIE A-levels. Got A*, A*, B, and A in Physics, Math, Chemistry, and General Paper. As far as standarized tests go, I have taken TOEFL (117/120), and I am taking ACT on October 22. As of now, I get 34-ish score on practice tests, and I am working to bring that up to a 35. On November 5, I am sitting for 3 SAT Subject Tests: Physics, Math 2, and Chemistry. 800s are practically possible on all three. 

Great Recommendation letters. 

Co-curriculuars: Participated in International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2015, but didn't win anything so I don't think it will boost my application. Apart from National Astronomy Olympiads, made the final round of National Physics Olympiad but couldn't make the final team. Again, since I from a small country, olympiads are not all that competitive as in US or China. So I fear colleges will consider these with all seriousness. 

Extra-curriculars: Debated in a bunch of national level debate contests. Won some. Named 'one of the best debaters' in two. In school's debate team and quiz team. Good performances in some national contests. 

Founded and lead a much needed 'public speaking club' in school. 

Other than these, some volunteering activities and some works. Certainly not as impressive as some kids in College Confidential do.

Stereotypes have given me a little hesitance about Princeton, despite how silly they might me. So I guess my questions just are -What is the atmosphere? Are there ways to balance academic rigor with fun campus life? Are you having fun?  Is it very elitist, pretentious? Does the competitive atmosphere create a kind of ""Where fun goes to die"" like UChicago? How preppy is it? Do you feel like you can be yourself? Most of all, do you like it? Obviously  you don't have to answer each of these individually, but I just kind of want general thoughts on Princeton outside of the basic academics.

0.0,1462310639.0,3.0,princeton,"Hi guys. Basically I didn't do too well in freshman and sophomore year in high school because of I was quite sick (in and out of the hospital constantly, make-shift clean-room in my room. that kind of fun stuff). Luckily I've gotten better and I'm doing better in school. Currently, I am a senior and for my junior and senior year I have a pretty good GPA (4.9/5) in heavy course load (5 semesters worth of credit in some colleges). I've decided to take a gap year and apply next year so I can show Princeton a bit more of myself. However, what I'm wondering is what direction of work do you think would be better. I'm a lib-arts guy but I enjoy math a lot so I thought maybe I could take some more advanced mathematics courses (multivariable calc or statistics) and some other courses like that. However, I'm also working on a couple of things such as a podcast I do once a week (which surprisingly a single 2 hour episode requires at least 15 hours of research, prep and editing to be decent so it's quite a bit of work). I'm also doing this internship which will be full time once school is over.

What would you recommend I focus on? I mean I can do both but obviously they'll both take a bit of a hit. Personally, I prefer to focus on my projects but I totally understand universities want to see more than 2 years of good academics. Any advice on this matter?

To any student who is still deciding between Princeton and elsewhere, I would like to give you my thoughts about Princeton and the college decision process.

I write this in part because I wish someone had told me these things when I was deciding, and also (admittedly) as a way for me to get my thoughts out of head.

I write this anonymously because I do not want people to remember me as that guy who ranted on the class of 2020 page. But if I could, this is what I would write on that page:


People will rarely tell you what is wrong with their college. You can ask, but they won't give you an honest answer. I know this because , as a prefrosh, I asked tons of current students about things they didn't like about here, and they rarely would give me a straight answer.

I have noticed that when students decide where they are attending, they gain this cult-like affinity for their college, refusing to believe other colleges could have possibly been a better choice. This is somewhat understandable, because people are generally trying to justify to themselves that they made the right choice, but on occasion it creates a fairly negative environment (like the Princeton Class of 20XY pages)

**The students on the class page are not representative of the college** 

The students on the class page are generally the more naive, outgoing people out there.

**Princeton has problems**

Upper classmen dining is socioeconomically stratified. The eating clubs are the rich and upper-middle students, independents are middle income students whose parents are making them pay through college, meal planners are generally the full-financial aid poor kids. As a kid from a poor background, this disgusts me.


**I made the wrong choice coming here**

If all financial aid were equal, I would be Harvey Mudd right now. If I attended there with the aid they offered me I would have had to go into debt, whereas here I got effectively full financial aid. I still wonder if going to HMC would have been worth the debt. Sometimes I wonder if another college that I got equal aid from would have been better as well.

**Students who do not like it here are isolated**

I have a small friend group that is connected simply by the fact that we don't love it here, and I can honestly say we all feel some level of isolation simply because we aren't apart of this group who LOVES it here.

**Yes, this campus is pretty. That doesn't matter as much as you think**

After waking up feeling like burntout shit for the fortieth night in a row, the beauty starts going over your head.


**Social life is homogenous**

If you don't find yourself attracted to either the eating club culture or the VERY specific type of ""alternative culture"" the Alternative (non-drinking) groups bring on campus, you will be hard pressed to find social situations you will strive in. 

People have gotten defensive when I simply *implied* I didn't love it here, as if me not liking it here affected them personally.


**Prestige is (mostly) meaningless**

If you would be successful here, chances are you'd be successful at a state school as well. This is with few concessions (such as jobs in finance). **You will forget what the name ""Princeton"" felt like when you got in. It will be replaced with normalcy**


**Culture is uppermiddle class here**

People act upper middle class, even if they aren't. People feel fake. People aren't directly competitive, but we *all* know we are competing for the same opportunities. However ambiguous this term is: ""fakeness"" is ubiquitous here.


**Fuck your parents**

If your parents are pressuring you to Princeton due to what it will mean for the family name, they aren't being good parents.

**Money does matter**

I feel isolated because I was poor as a kid here. Princeton DOES do a good job of making me feel well off here. They gave me a top-of-the-line laptop, an iPad, and financial aid. *I am eternally grateful for this*. But I still feel isolated. People talk about being ""broke"" because they spent too much going shopping at Sperry's. Someone once said I looked homeless behind my back because my shoes had a hole in them and I was wearing some well-worn jeans. Wealth is pervasive here.

**There is a competitive culture here, it just isn't explicit**


I could go on, but I feel like I am already rambling on. I am certain this is hard to follow but I hope it is helpful to someone.

**To conclude:** Let me be clear here-- a LOT of people do like it here, but they are generally who you are hearing from on the class of 2020 page and whatnot. My point is, the people who do not love it are generally silent because they feel isolated enough as is.

I was invited or contacted, whichever you prefer, for a college interview for Princeton in very early January, with the actual interview having taken place on January 4th. I had submitted my Princeton application on December 13th and was seemingly contacted immediately after the turn of the year on January 2nd. Is this coincidental? I am asking because I saw another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/43e683/international_applicant_invited_for_an_interview/) on this subreddit that was about an international application who had questions regarding the interview about what to expect. One person [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/43e683/international_applicant_invited_for_an_interview/czhqhxo), and I quote:

&gt;The thing is given that you got an interview, it means you are already a **qualified applicant**, and they are looking for qualified applicants that are ""interesting"", ie seem motivated, engaging, and well, actually interested in going to Princeton.

Is that the reason why I was contacted so quickly for an interview?

Had the admissions committee somehow glanced over my application, seen something they liked, making me a qualified applicant, and wanted to interview me ASAP, or was the interview just convenient at that time?

Thanks in advance!

Im doing the first year which is common to all science and engineering and still cannot decide wether I should study Mechanical Engineering or Physics. Some background on how degrees work here in Argentina: Physics degree has an estimated duration of 7 years, It has everything Physics and a lot of laboratories. As well as a Thesis on the last year. In the US its probably considered as a bachelors and a little more. The mechanical engineering degree has an estimated duration of six years. Also the last year you have an option of a Thesis. 

Anyways, Im planning on continuing my education. I really like them both and lately I have been thinking of doing ""both"". Like for example Physics here, then study abroad and get a masters in mechanical engineering and a Phd in either mechanical/aerospace engineering or Physics. 

Which degree do you think it will be better? Considering the duration. Also, If I study mechanical engineering firstly I will get a lot of skills which would allow me to live a really good life here in Argentina so if I for some reason change my mind I would have that backup plan. Whereas, with Physics my options are not that wide but the education might be more thorough.

I was looking at some Princeton admission pages and it said that their utmost priority is the ""rigor of Secondary school record"". The internet has conflicting info on this. Does this mean how much you challenged yourself and how many of the hardest courses you took, or does this mean how difficult your high school is? If applicant A comes from fancy private school with about normal to fairly rigorous record, and applicant B comes from normal public high school, and took the most challenging courses (Which may or may not be more than student A due to the courses offered at their school), who would get admitted? I am essentially trying to figure out if I am at a disadvantage by going to a local public high school that is near by.

1) As a prospective premed student, the majors seem a little limited compared to Cornell, for example EEB or Molecular Bio. Will this affect me in any significant way?

2) The idea of a thesis seems intimidating yet cool at the same time. How helpful were the faculty in helping write the thesis and overall how difficult is it?

3) A lot of people are telling me to not come here because it is ""preppy."" Understanding that this is mostly a myth, how easy is it for your average middle-class student to fit in?

4) This question is about the grading system: How does it work exactly? And does the attempt to curb inflation help or hinder students?

5) How are the opportunities for extracurriculars like research or volunteering on and off campus? Given the relative proximity to NYC compared to Cornell, how feasible is it to do something in NYC on weekends perhaps?

6) What are your opinions on the dorming system?

I am visiting on Sunday to get more of a feel of the campus and environment there, which will surely help me decide. Thanks guys, I would really appreciate your opinions.",Some questions from a prospective freshman undergraduate - would appreciate answers soon.,t3_365y61,7.0,1.0

I've had people tell me it looks like I'm trying to pay my way into a good school, but I am going there for almost free (paying about the same amount as I did going to a local summer camp last summer). But I've also had people say it's a great opportunity to build connections with professors from high ranking universities such as these (recommendations). 

Is there anyone here that attended any sort of prestigious-college summer camp? If so, a) how did it affect you, b) do you think that either the experience or how it looked helped you to get into Princeton?",Summer programs?,t3_34kmx9,1.0,0.67
