there is also the side factor that these units would have been in classes that all felt pretty meaningless/purposeless, which may have been why i felt so much less motivation than on campus. also, i am doing way more extracurriculars this year.

To say that I am disappointed by the lack of solidarity from the Stanford community, would be an understatement.

I implore you to think about our equal moral worth as human beings, and more than that, about our shared claim to the Stanford experience. Have we not all studied in Green Library, snuck onto the roof at MemChu, ate a delicious hot dog at Caspar dining? Does this mean nothing to you?

The vitriol and anger currently circulating will engender harrowing consequences for our institution and for the free market system. If left unchecked, I fear this company’s IPO may be blocked, and they could even face delinquency. Need I remind you of how Stanford has [fallen so drastically short](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ps2PNZh) in recent global metrics?

Although I'd appreciate any advice or comments, soliciting them isn't my intention.

I'm currently living on campus with my friends. I love them all; they're incredibly chill, full of energy and fun to be around. But as an international student, I feel out of place. There are so many references that go over my head, like the cartoons and TV shows they watched growing up, the music hits of middle school and vines that I've never been exposed to. It feels really hard to relate or contribute to conversations. Often, I feel like I have no opinions about things. My friends would debate which Miley Cyrus song is the best banger or which Disney channel actor/actress turned to be the hottest as they grew up. I've never really thought about those things, and don't understand the circumstances that would force one to, yet my friends seem to have immediate strong opinions about these things and have come up with lines of reasoning explaining their positions. Coupled with the fact that half the time I don't know what they're debating, it always feels like I'm just an observer in the friend group. I feel like they forget I exist, and by extension I feel like an outsider.

It doesn't help that I already have issues with active listening, vocabulary recall or expressing myself on the spot. English is not my first language, and I've only been conversing in it for a few years. This is also exacerbated by the fact that 18 years of living with a manipulative, hot-tempered mom has taught me to be agreeable and actively seek to please the people around me. I often just nod, smile or laugh, not knowing what for. These reflexes seem to be programmed in me. Whenever I try to overcome them, try to be true to myself, I'm hit with self-worth issues. Nothing about my life, at least to me, seems worth sharing. I don't have any funny anecdotes, while my friends always seem to have something funny that's happened to them recently. Adding to that, I hate my body, every bit of it. Although I know that my friends don't view my as ugly per se, they always throw around the word ""fat"" negatively. It makes me question if that connotation carries in the way the see me.

Perhaps the only time where I'm truly able to be ""me"", is when I'm drunk or high. So whenever I have the chance to, I always get really drunk, and try to get everyone around me to be drunk. It's the only time where I know I have an excuse if I say something that people would conventionally deem stupid or of no value to the conversation. Heck, my friends would just laugh because they're drunk. It's the only time where I can say the word ""like"" six times in the same sentence because I don't know what the English word for the specific thing I'm trying to describe is. People would think I'm just too drunk, that I'm not dumb. This has been very unhealthy because drinking alcohol or smoking weed seem to ruin my mood for the next few days.

So, even though I'm surrounded by people I love and admire, who I know I can count on, I feel alone. I don't know how I'd ever bring this up to them. Hell, saying this makes me question if they really see me as a friend or they just keep me around because I'm a ""generally nice person"". And the thing is, I know they're good people, but I also know that they wouldn't know how to respond or act if I ever told them this. I don't even know how to begin expressing myself, like would I call a ""friend group meeting"" and put myself under the spotlight? That just seems too dramatic. Even if I manage to do that, I know the moment I start to speak, my entire vocabulary will just disappear, my thoughts and feelings will no longer feel valid or worth listening to. I can't bear the feeling of making anyone feel even a little bit bad or sad. My whole life prior to Stanford was walking on egg shells trying not to trigger my mom, not to have her throw shit and break shit, not to hear her scream and stop talking to me for days on end.

All of these things, and many other things, compounded with school work and fucking PWR2 (that seems to incorporate even more work than a normal year would have) serves only to fuel sixty different voices in my head that I have no control over. I can't stop thinking. I can't stop hating myself, hating the circumstances that made me the way I am, hating every piece of my existence. Closing my eyes, and imagining my existence melt away is the only thing that brings me peace. I don't know what to do with myself. I've been trying so hard, but there's very little left in me.

I was going to go for the Stanford Global Studies internship in Hong Kong (CS education), but I still haven’t asked found a recommender, so I think that opportunity is a dud.  But I really don’t have a clue where else I should look for opportunities. Ive tried Handshake, but the process feels so automated, and since I don’t really have much experience, I feel like I’ll just get rejected.

I'll be applying to the ICME masters program next year, and I am looking for advice on whether I should apply to the data science vs. computational finance track. I am a CS/Stats major with SWE internships, so my profile is much more suited for the data science track. However, I am seeking a masters because I want to transition into quant finance, so my top choice is comp. finance, but I have 0 prior internships in finance.

Some questions I have are:

1. Which track should I apply to, given that (i) my top choice is the finance track, (ii) I have no finance work experience, and (iii) my profile is much more relevant for data science?
2. Is it possible to switch tracks once you're in the program? If so, I am thinking it might be a good idea to apply to data science, but I've also heard there are far more applicants for DS than there are for finance, so I might have better chances applying to finance in this case.

But I can’t stand the pressure and lack of empathy just because you go to Stanford. It’s a horrible place to fail. I can't stop the bleeding. It's a fit for the best students. There is little room for anyone else. I may need to leave because of it but before I do - has any one found a way past this? It seems like a serious issue that we never talk about. Posted this on Cardinal Confessions but it’s not a place for serious discussion. I need some advice on what to do. Do I stay or should I find another place where I can heal?

I suffer from severe suicidal depression for almost all of my life and I tried to kill myself. I got hospitalized. It didn't help. I remember my roommate throwing feces at the wall and yelling how he needed to tell Obama to retrieve an ancient artifact in Africa to save the world. One inmate routinely stole the clothes of other inmates. He would run around wearing them screeching unholy sounds. Another inmate followed me around threatening to kill me. During my week there, I was awakened by deafening psychotic screaming at nothing and no one every morning. My psychiatrist thinks I suffer PTSD from that experience. I routinely wake up screaming in the middle of the night after having nightmares about being stuck there again. I also got kicked out of Stanford. I tried to seek help in my hometown. When I told a therapist about my attempted suicide, she felt sad. But when I told her I went to Stanford. She told me to perk up because my life wasn’t so bad because Stanford has a lot of opportunities. She told me people would be so impressed that I went to Stanford. I could get a job and find a spouse and that’d be the end of it. We also did this fun exercise where I listed all the reasons why I wanted to commit suicide. For each reason I listed, she would tell me that they were invalid. Every time I would veer into a reason, she would remind me I could get a spouse and a job. Not a great job or spouse but just anyone and any job. I returned to Stanford. When I told my psychiatrist in Palo Alto I was worried about my grades (bottom 5%), she told me I shouldn’t worry and that I (a low-income student of color) was being another entitled Stanford student for worrying about grades so much. She told me that the Stanford name was so prestigious and everyone would want to hire a person with a fancy Stanford degree. She told me that Stanford people will always get jobs. Instead of listening to me, she claimed I was being ridiculous. She accused me of only wanting to get good grades because I craved validation from my teachers to compensate for insecurity. She pushed this outrageous claim despite evidence to the contrary and the fact that I needed to worry about my grades because I was on the verge of failing out. I later went on academic probation because I couldn't get out of bed to take my finals. I had my first internship rescinded because I didn’t meet GPA requirements.  I told my TA I was having trouble turning in assignments and going to class because I couldn’t get out of bed and was still adjusting to the odd impacts of extremely potent medication. He said that it was all my fault for struggling in school and that I had made extremely poor decisions which would have very little impact on my life. He talked about how much harder his undergrad at Berkeley was. He went on and on about how Berkeley was superior because there was no hand-holding and I was a privileged Stanford undergrad who cries because I can’t get what I want. He told me that the only difference between Stanford and Berkeley is that Berkeley had actual bite and that I would be kicked out of Berkeley had I gone to Berkeley instead. He told me at Berkeley 30% of students fail each class. The strong survive as the numbers dwindle but everyone develops real respect for each other because vast numbers of people fail out of Berkeley. He told me that if I couldn’t take insults I should leave engineering because real engineers tell it like it is. He yelled at me saying I should have majored in something like the humanities where people are always handing out compliments and only say positive happy things.

The culture is always happy. No one talks about how they’re struggling. I find it hard to make friends once they know the shit I’ve been through. One person told me “We can’t be friends because you are mentally ill and don’t have your shit together”. I told someone I had attempted suicide. They told me they didn't want to be around me because they ""didn't want to get run over by the crazy train and you'll do nothing with your life."" I told my friend that I was having trouble getting out of bed and was suicidal. My friend told me that I just need to be more studious and everything will all be fine. I'll never forget my friend telling ""You just need to do the work. It's easy."" I told some people that I was thinking of killing myself and they brushed it off as me trying to seek attention. I remember making some ""friends""  early in an intro engineering class. We did great until the midterm when I struggled to grasp the material and function once my health deteriorated. I couldn't put on a mask at that point in the quarter and came to problem set sessions so exhausted I couldn't figure anything out. I wasn't copying answers or anything. I just stopping contributing to the group's formulation of solutions and was confused at everything. After that, they began to ghost me. I finally ran into one of them. They told me off explaining ""I thought you knew something because you were excited about the class. But it's apparent you know nothing. I have no use for you in my life."" It’s as if people just want to be friends so that can network for prestigious careers later on. Stanford is dying. It's increasingly becoming a pre-professional tech feeder school where the already privileged can network some more; grab a few big titles before launching into big soulless tech company #1. There's still a culture at Stanford full of excited, passionate,  and irreverent students who want to learn everything possible. I'll never forget taking shots and drunkenly arguing about moral relativity with a Rhodes Scholar. I'll never forget discussing quantum physics with a Hertz Fellow over a game of billards. I'll never forget the times I stayed up late discussing fun finance schemes. I'll never forget launching a balloon into orbit with my dorm just because we could. I hold these memories dear but they are becoming increasingly extinct as my life unravels. When I was doing well and had a future, I benefitted from the passionate students and drive to do something great. But when I need real friends to cry with - there’s no one. It’s as if this entire university is becoming a place for networking into flashy careers. Fake smiles and fake California valley girls abound.

This place is a go-go-go atmosphere for the best students. There is no room for anyone else. We have grade inflation and support but the mentality is very much “You have so much so people dictate that you should be not just doing well but really, really, really on top of the world.” Here's the thing about Stanford, you have so much so if you happen to fail then it's your fault. Even if it's because of things that were your not your fault or outside of your control, you're expected to overcome them no matter what because it's you know Stanford. I get no sympathy from my peers for my struggles. I was an engineering major. I struggled in it but pushed on believing that it was for me. I was in every office hours. Spent 20-30 hours on so many of my problem sets. When I told students and professors this, they told me to start earlier and that I was being lazy. Professors are resentful of our safety net. I once asked a question and the professor told me Stanford holds my hand a lot but this is ridiculous. This question is so stupid that 99% of real engineers would have googled it up before asking it. Professors and graduate students hate the shit out of undergraduates. They’re generally awful teachers because they’re human beings going through a brutal and inequitable system. My friend TA’ed for a professor and he told me that the professor would take photos of failed undergrad exams so he could laugh at it and feel better about himself when he was going through a hard time. There is no real development. You really have to do it on your own. Only the very prepared kids can take advantage of Stanford. The chemistry program at my large underresourced public high school was awful and didn't prepare me at all. I took a freshman chem introsem to learn without pressure. When the professor found out I didn't know what photolithography was - he was shocked and told me that I was a moron. He told me that ""we should get an x-ray to scan your head to see if you have a brain"". He would often interject into class periods about how he was shocked I didn't learn about chemistry. I would try to explain I came from an underresourced high school but he wouldn't have any of it. He kept on driving onto my chemistry ignorance to embarrass me and laugh at basic concepts that I didn't know. He would constantly cold call on me in order to expose my ignorance. Never in the entire quarter did he cold call anyone else. I asked him to stop embarrassing me in front of the entire class. He responded by yelling ""It's the truth!"". There’s a safety net and you’ll graduate but it just feels like I’m grinding and barely staying afloat but not really getting any mentorship. I saw all the wrong signs but failed to steer clear because suffering is social currency in engineering departments.  I stayed up 48 hours for one of my projects. I had a professor chew me out for showing up late to lab because I couldn’t get out of bed. I went on academic probation because I couldn’t get out of bed to take any of my finals. The staff aren't generally great. Before I got hospitalized, I went to see my summer housing director for support. She had the empathy of a brick wall. She told me how great it is to be at Stanford and how privileged I am since I can get a cushy tech job at fancy big name companies like Facebook, Google, Palantir and so on. After I returned from my forced leave, I had to meet with a residence dean for months. I already had a therapist but she contacted me biweekly for meetings. She was just so patronizing. I felt like a misbehaving 3rd grader in the principal's office. She was checking up on me constantly to make sure I wasn't a liability for the school instead of being an actual resource. I had tried to kill myself and she told me that at least we're not in Afghanistan - we're at Stanford. I think she was trying to say we have more resources but it felt tone-deaf. I was constantly hearing ""at least it could be worse"" but it made me feel like my suffering didn't matter because there was always worse out in the real world. It's demoralizing to hear. How are you supposed to succeed in the real world if you can't make it in a cushy place like Stanford? Why live if life is going to get worse than failing at Stanford? I saw an academic advisor. I told her I was scared of failing out and that at any other school I would have failed out - basically what my TA told me. She laughed and reaffirmed that I would have failed out at any other school.

When I was okay, Stanford felt amazing but when I wasn’t okay (which is a lot of the time), Stanford felt god awful. I do believe Stanford is a great place and the best school in the world but it's not a place for struggling students or anyone who happens to stumble. Before I apply for additional quarters of financial aid, I wonder if I should because Stanford is such an awful place to fail. When I tell people I go to Stanford, people are impressed but people really assume that my life is set. This kills me. My life is not set.

I am a low-income student of color who grew up in the projects. My parents are refugees. I worked throughout all of high school to help our family stay afloat because my father became disabled and couldn’t work. I grew up thinking gunshots in the night are normal. I dressed so poorly - that I received donations in my backpack one day because concerned teachers were worried that I was going to become homeless.

We talk about how privileged Stanford kids are but it hurts because I don’t feel like a human deserving empathy because I have the Stanford name. To them, Stanford means that I am a privileged elite whose life is set. As if going to Stanford can undo the trauma of being a poor person of color in America. Once you go to Stanford, you'll never be an underdog ever again no matter how disadvantaged your background was coming in. I know people who had private K-12s and extremely wealthy parents growing up. Somehow I am the more privileged person in society's eyes because I went to Stanford and they went to state schools. I seriously wonder if I can pick myself back up again. Stanford was home for me but I'm starting to think it was worst possible place for me to attend. We talk about privilege but don’t talk about the serious detriments it has on healing and failure. I wonder if I should do it here or elsewhere. I don’t really don’t have much to look forward to in life. I don't think I'm meant to be happy. I have lost the rat race to pump as much dopamine as possible into a three pound slab of meat in your skull. I want to be as sentient as the stars and the stones. I just want the hurt to stop.

I'm seriously considering taking a gap year (GY) before I enter university. (My school has done an honorable but poor job at keeping the regular caliber of my schoolwork high, and I feel a tad intellectually/academically stunted. I've also been online for a whole year now and don't want to make it two.) I have tentative plans to work/intern for most of the 15 months between HS graduation and the start of my freshman year. I am also looking for some months-long scholarship/ work-and-travel programs that are fun and intellectually engaging (LMK if you know of any!).

I'm a little uneasy to take a gap year, admittedly. Given the current geopolitical climate, innumerable complications due to the Pandemic, and my corporate inexperience, I feel that I might have very limited options. Another thing is money— my parents, understandably, are not cool with paying for all of my expenses (like rent and food) especially if the job I'm working is lower-paying and I'm essentially losing money as well. I would prefer to go abroad, but the chances of doing so could dwindle in the coming months. 

So my questions are (assuming SU allows me to defer a year)—
1. To those who have taken GYs, did you do internships/scholarship programs? If so, where?
2. Where do you think I should continue my search for GY activities?
3. Is extracurricular enrichment at all the best route to go during a gap year?

### Deadline Sunday, Jan. 17 (11:59pm PST)

Are you passionate about **global development**? Do you want to learn more about global poverty and effective interventions? Apply to join One for the World’s Global Development Fellowship this winter to go in-depth into the topic of global development - we will focus on the key issues the world is facing right now in tackling global poverty. This fellowship will feature **1-on-1 mentorship, speaker events, career workshops, and mixers** to help you gain more perspectives towards this topic and meet other passionate, lovely humans. 

### What does this fellowship look like?

The fellowship will focus on a different aspect of global development each week. You will get assigned a group and a mentor to participate in weekly discussions. There will also be speaker events, career workshops, and mixers throughout the fellowship.

Topics in the fellowship include:

* **Moral agency** in global development - is it wrong not to help?
* **Economics** behind global development - how well do we understand the problem?
* **Global health and interventions** \- how can we minimize the harms of preventable diseases to the global poor?
* **Philanthropy and its effectiveness** \- what is the most effective way of helping the global poor? 
* **Human rights** \- how do first world countries and organizations like the UN affect the problem?

### Who are we?

One for the World @ Stanford is a student group dedicated to ending extreme poverty by revolutionizing charitable giving. Those in the U.S. and Stanford students especially are often the highest earners in the world, with a significant potential for outsized impact. By educating others about effective giving, we thus hope to improve the lives of people around the world.

We are a chapter of [One for the World](https://www.1fortheworld.org/), an international nonprofit organization dedicated to this same purpose. Since 2014, One for the World has motivated thousands of students to take a pledge to donate 1% of their income and has donated over $750,000 to effective charities.

The Viktor Zhdanov Fellowship gets its name from a Ukrainian virologist who was largely responsible for eradicating smallpox. He was the deputy minister of health for the Soviet Union and developed a visionary plan to eradicate the disease, which the WHO agreed to form a campaign around. 

**Questions?** 

Please reach out to [emma123@stanford.edu](mailto:emma123@stanford.edu) or [jchen23@stanford.edu](mailto:jchen23@stanford.edu) for any questions about the fellowship or One for the World @ Stanford.

I mean I know it is my first quarter here at Stanford and during my really emotionally devastating and stressful attempt to fight this process, I realized that my consequences were a lot less worse than I made them out to be and only felt more anxious about it because it seemed so bad.

I plan on retaking the class next quarter so my GPA is not complete trash. 

But I wanted to know if anyone understands how the process works beyond accepting the charges. 

I wanted to know what the possible consequences were. The judicial counselor has yet to file charges, but is it possible that the sanction agreement with them is negotiable if I don’t want to go to a panel, I mean if I chose the Early Resolution Option. My professor painted my actions and that of others involved as something that is worse than it actually is and I was wondering if the OFCS sees the standard  punishment as something that has to be done, or different for every individual case.

My actions involved indirectly mentioning a sequence used for a particular question of a test on a public platform and I was identified.

Long term, do you think that this sort of action is something that is relevant to Coterm applications. When I first signed the Honor Code earlier in the school year, I didn’t completely understand its nuances. If I do a complete 180, do you think it is something I have to disclose to certain departments. I am not interested in medical school or law school, both of whom require disclosing Honor Code violations, but do others ask about it. I mean, I do not think I’ll be suspended for a quarter and I don’t have to explain retaking an entry level class right?

Also is an Honor Code violation something that is required to disclose to research opportunities or internships, or Stanford study abroad programs. I am undecided and what stressed me out the most about this process was the fact that I closed these doors.

Below are my planned classes below for my first 3 quarters (not including IntroSems, Ways, etc.).

 Since English would be a BA. and CS would be a BS. would i be able to double major as I had hoped? Would that just become a BAS and then we’d be allowed to pursue both? Or how does that work? Would it not be allowed?

At Stanford, back when it was in-person, I was constantly speaking English, from smalltalk in lecture, to random late night philosophical discussions, to commiserating in office hours.

Since I'm at home in virtual school, I basically lost the ability to speak English. BTW, English is my most ""advanced"" language, and I live in the US. The issue is that I speak a different language at home on a day-to-day basis.

Sure, all the media I consume is in English and I text friends in English, but I rarely ever get the chance to speak it. Throughout the quarter, I only spoke English during group project meetings, and occasional group Zoom calls with friends. Which isn't too substantial, to be honest.

The last time I was constantly speaking English was back in September, during my summer job. Recently, I was in a 1-on-1 conversation with a friend (not a group setting, so I actually have to talk), and I realized my English skills have really atrophied since September. I know what I want to say, but the correct words just don't come to my mind. Has anybody experienced this? Any tips on how to cope?

My current method is to intentionally spend time everyday talking to myself about random topics in English, so I can improve bit by bit. But I am also looking for other ways.

I was wondering if anyone had any experience getting financial aid to pay for an airbnb they were staying in. I saw that it just says to upload your rental agreement with your name. 

I guess I'm a bit confused that there don't seem to be any more guidelines besides that, such as a rent maximum they would cover (or is that just based on how much financial aid you receive?). I.e. if there was no maximum, would people not just pick a super nice airbnb in hopes of financial aid covering it? 

Also, does anyone know if living in two separate locations would impact this (was originally planning on moving back home/somewhere rent-free for the end of the quarter if financial aid didn't pull through).

Initially, I was going to continue with the 60 series. However, I would then need to take a regular quarter in the summer, since both Math 63CM and Physics 65 are only offered in the summer. Skipping ahead would also give more time for physics electives in the future.

If I take Physics 120 instead, I can take it during the spring, along with a Think course, CS 107, possibly mandarin, and whatever else looks interesting. Then, I could have my flex quarter in the summer, taking the math class and hopefully doing physics research.

I've taken AP Physics C in high school, both mechanics and E&amp;M, and have had exposure to some introductory quantum mechanics. I don't know vector calculus or differential equations super well, but I've learned a bit and feel that I can self-study the topics over break and during the course.

My physics professor doesn't recommend doing this, since you should have learned the math before going into this, as well as the PDE course pre/coreq (which I don't plan on taking because unit count, currently planning to take 18). She also says that the 60 series gives a strong foundation, but I feel that my foundation is already pretty solid physics-wise at least, and I feel up for the challenge of skipping ahead.

Ever since I was young I was very interested in science, particularly physics and I've always intended on pursuing it in the future. My parents were happy about it because they see STEM has being the ""safe"" way for a job, especially my dad who is a scientist. But for the past 5 years or so I've been starting to have different thoughts as I experienced new things. I'm much more excited and intrigued about political science and history now. In my last 2 years of high school I was thinking that I'm not that interested or good at math, and now after almost being done with my first quarter at Stanford this thought is very much solidified. I really don't like my math and CS class right now (purely for the subject, the professors are great)- only my political science classes right now are giving me any happiness.

I guess I'm a bit nervous about switching from pursuing STEM to humanities, partially because I'm worried about career prospects and I'm worried about my parents disapproving. And also it feels weird to finally admit that I care about humanities more because whenever I had that thought I always tried to convince myself that I wanted to do STEM.

And I'm also feeling a bit regretful because now I've kind of fucked my GPA because I think I'm only going to be able to manage to get a B/B+ in my calculus and CS class. I know those classes are not very relevant to polisci so maybe it doesn't matter that much, but I guess I'm more concerned about just how my overall GPA looks on paper.

Frosh here. My parents just told me that they aren't sure we can afford Stanford for the rest of the year.

Their preference, however, would be for me to take a LoA for the rest of frosh year and take community college courses so that I can come in with sophomore standing (thus reducing how much they have to pay). Is this even possible?

Otherwise, are there any other options? Could I apply for FA this late?

TLDR; a couple of Stanford alums and I wanted to help students save their favorite memories especially at a time like this so we made an absolutely, completely, no bull-sh\*ttingly free one-line-a-day journal just for that.

I'm super lazy and have tried to journal multiple times. Bullet journals, one entry at night, one entry at day, etc, etc. Tried everything. At the beginning of quarantine, all of our days were beginning to mush together and I was losing track of what specific day of the week it was. It was just pset after pset and I literally was keeping track of my days by what number pset for CS 161 I was on. And then my friend hit me up about his one line journal idea and that's how we got started working on our journal!

Inspired by my friend's approach to his four years here, we made something that let's you save one ""gold nugget"", or one favorite memory, from your day to our app. We tried to make it as effortless and easy as possible so even the laziest and most forgetful people like myself still log one line a day. It's really just as simple as that.

No, it doesn't have ads. Nor does it have some kind of premium service (idk we haven't really thought about how to make money off of this). This has been our pure product of labor for the past few months and we just wanted to help Stanford students save their best memories in a place where you can go back and reminisce all about how you and your friends accidentally ran a stop sign and got pulled over by campus police or that time you went to your first screw-your-roo. We really want Stanford students to savor their experience even if it isn't on campus. With the quarter system being so brutal and Stanford's constant go go go mentality, it's super easy to just let the four years rush on by without stopping to remember all of your moments. So, we hope this can help with that. 

It would mean the world to us if you downloaded it from whatever platform you're on and gave us feedback! Absolutely roast us on the review if you thought it sucked or praise it and give it five stars! And if you want to read more about our thought process into how we made it, you can read more here  [https://medium.com/@alecq.deng/how-we-throw-away-our-own-happiness-96628f10650b](https://medium.com/@alecq.deng/how-we-throw-away-our-own-happiness-96628f10650b).

So, I am a frosh currently taking Math 61CM. I absolutely love math and it is one of the prospective majors for me. The math 61CM class is SUCH a grind but I've found a really awesome community of friends in the class and I thoroughly enjoy the beauty of the problems and working on the PSETs. Its a loooot of time effort - I'd say at least 3-4 hours a day just understanding the material, plus 10-15 hours working on the weekly PSETS. However, for the course, I honestly don't mind. 

But I just got got the grades back from the first midterm and my score is in the bottom 25% of the class. I'm getting decent scores (few points off) on the psets. I would just suck it up and work even harder for the class but I can safely say I'm at my workload limit - I'm taking 20 units (13 of which are all prereqs for prospective majors, and a CS class that honestly is pretty chill, plus a couple of 1 units). 

Besides being on the bottom 25%, the top 25% of the class got a score of 97.5%+. Im trying to understand how the class is curved, and assuming I continue scoring like this, how likely is it I pass the course?

Because I'm honestly willing to switch to credit/no credit and slog through bc of how much I love the class, I just can't afford to not receive credit for the course.

I also don't have any linear algebra background, but I'd consider myself generally strong in math in a non-stanfordian perspective. So ideally, if I were to drop the course I could switch into math 51 + 56, but as a frosh I'm not allowed to take more units and the drop deadline for my other courses has passed, so I can't use math 56 as a Segway to proof based mathematics this quarter either.

Anyway, any advice from people who might have gone through something similar before, whether in math or another discipline? Also any advice on how courses tend to be curved and where I might stack up as well might be helpful.

&gt;Furr wrote that students living in on-campus residences will be allowed to form “households” or “social pods,” comprising no more than eight students, within housing facilities. Social pods will be required to register with Stanford to “facilitate contact tracing.” Those living in social pods will be able to interact with each other “as would members of a household”— effectively allowing students to interact with up to eight community members without social distancing or having to wear masks, provided they are distanced from other pods. 

OCH email yesterday:

&gt;Just as an FYI, further clarification on the new guidelines for how to make and register “households” of 8 people will be released early next week, so please keep your eyes peeled for that important information. 

It is a good thing that the University has taken student concerns about mental health an the overall strictness of the compact seriously. But I don't think officially registering a ""pod"" makes very much sense. Friendships and romantic relationships can change unpredictably. Forcing people to pre-register these creates some of the same problems associated with the original draconian version of the rules, and it puts people in a very uncomfortable position of having to rank their personal relationships and negotiate with others.

It's also, simultaneously, a bit too permissive. With the caveat that the full set of rules haven't been published yet, 8 people is a lot and if these pods cut across actual households (people who live together) you can end up ""linking"" a *lot* of people. Just a probably-not-typical example to prove a point: Say you have a bunch of households of *m* people, each person in each household is a member of a different pod. Worst case:

1. You're directly exposed to up to 6 + m people
2. You're two degrees away from up to another 14(m-1) people
3. You're three degrees away from 49(m-1)+ 6m\^2. 

For m &gt; 2, this is pretty bad. My point here isn't that it increases a lot in *degrees* (this is always the case) but it increases rapidly in *m*. This can be mitigated by limiting the number of unique pods per real household, but that makes the negotiation problem so much worse. Not only do I have to rank my friends, but I have to take my roommates and my friends' roommates priorities into account? Maybe if we give Paul Milgrom a few years and a juicy research grant he can solve this problem. (Also note that more restrictions on pods --&gt; more people seeing eachother against the rules --&gt; more cross-household linkage.)

A better alternative would be something like: You can visit *n* number of people outside your household a week, or between negative tests.\* Outdoor 6-foot interaction with masks would not count. And even for indoor interaction that counts, the rule should be **wear masks unless you're doing something which prevents it**. Putting a piece of cloth on your face is such a small ask compared to everything else.

You could of course debate what *n* should be, whether Stanford and non-Stanford people should count the same way, and it would of course be hard to enforce. But I submit that pretty much any problem with this system is also going to occur with the pods. The proposed alternative could be implemented as a ""pod"" system where you can update your pod every week. That sounds more complicated but I would argue it's actually a lot easier, because the stakes are just who you see that week.

The problem is my schedule is already full, and I haven’t started any of the courses needed for med schools. I’m 2024 by the way.

This quarter I have the following:
- Language (required, have to take it if I want to get it out of the way this year) 5 units 

- Psych 1 5 units 

- Peer Counseling — 2 units (I might drop this because I can always do it later)

- A bio seminar that I am going to be dropping — 3 units  

I’ve heard it’s good to start chemistry, however this conflicts with Psych 1. Also, next quarter I have two required courses that take up 8 units combined. I also have my language (continues through three quarters) and possibly and introsem. That means my next quarter is already booked at 16 units. So if I started math this quarter, I wouldn’t be able to continue it until spring.

1599594040.0,0.0,87.0,"Some advice for incoming frosh:

Coursework: Don't drown yourself in classes. Every year, many frosh end up overcommitting academically in fall quarter, despite advice from upperclassmen and [academic advisors](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/academic-planning/cardinal-compass/your-questions-answered/how-do-i-decide-how-many-classes-take). Most people will tell you that the best part about Stanford is the people, and it's true. It's difficult to make the most of the Stanford community when you're bogged down with homework and deadlines. Take the time to meet as many people as possible, even if it's virtually!

Introsems: Take them! A great way to interact with professors and your peers in a more intimate setting. [introsems.stanford.edu](https://introsems.stanford.edu)

Academic Progress: You're not in a race with your peers. Don't stress if you feel that others are ahead of you in a course sequence, have coded since high-school or have written 10,000-word research papers. Everyone completes their degree at a different pace, so take your time and take advantage of Stanford's many [tutoring and advising resources](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/tutoring-support/tutoring). Do yourself a favor and go through Stanford at your own pace – more on this below.

Class Engagement: As many of you will know from high school, it can be easy to get by in some classes without really engaging with the material or learning much from the course. This is also the case for some courses at Stanford. Stanford has world-renowned professors and incredible courses, so make the most of them. The more you put into your classes, the more you'll get out. If you're taking lots of heavy classes in one quarter, you'll quickly find that it can be difficult to stay fully engaged with each course.

Course Selection: [Fast Courses](https://fastcourses.org) is a faster way to browse through courses than Carta. Spend some time before the quarter starts exploring courses on ExploreCourses and FastCourses – more often than not, you'll discover a course that you didn't know existed. Browsing through hundreds of courses can be a tedious task, but use the filters to narrow down your search. Also, it's always a great idea to ask your friends what they're taking!

Office Hours: Office hours are revered by Stanford students. Show up with any number of difficult questions from your homework, and your professor or TA will usually point you in the right direction. Most core classes have bustling office hour sessions, but don't worry if you're the only one who attends these sessions for your class. If you need help with coursework, or you just want to get to know your professor, office hours are a great place to start.

Syllabi: Check out the syllabus for your class to get an idea of workload and course structure – some professors are better than others at posting these before classes start. Find them here: [https://syllabus.stanford.edu/syllabus/](https://syllabus.stanford.edu/syllabus/)

Extracurriculars/Student Organizations: Student organizations are a great way to meet people with similar interests and are a cornerstone of many students' undergraduate experience. Attend the virtual activities fair and learn more about Stanford's many student organizations. Like classes, don't overcommit yourself and take time to explore organizations that interest you. Feel free to drop a club commitment if it's too much and also know that some student organizations welcome students joining at any time of the year. Here is a [list of clubs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17eCKvaDIgKk6ZzhduXqET0a2YZFyK6Z9acRgxzA_DOk/edit) compiled by Stanford.

Language Requirement: Review the language requirement and think about when you want to start your language course sequence. You can fulfil the requirement anytime during your undergraduate career, but some students prefer completing the language course sequence early on. [https://language.stanford.edu/academics/language-requirement](https://language.stanford.edu/academics/language-requirement)

Majors/Minors: Four years is more than enough time to be successful in your major and maybe even pick up a minor or two along the way. Note that if you're considering a double major, you'll have a little less flexibility with your course selection and more planning is needed earlier on. Having said that, most Stanford undergraduates end up with one major. As mentioned above, if you need to space out difficult major classes over a couple of quarters rather than doing 2-3 core courses in one quarter, give yourself that space. Again, it's not a race.

Four Year Plans: I won't say too much about these other than that they can be useful for some students as a reference point but are likely to change as new courses are offered each year. If you're curious about your progress towards a certain major, read the undergraduate handbook for your major department (can be found on department website) and speak with your academic advisor.

Thinking Matters and PWR 1: Both of these are requirements for frosh. Certain programs (ESF) fulfil these requirements. Sophomores have PWR 2! Learn more about Thinking Matters [here](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/thinking-matters) and PWR 1 [here](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-1/pwr-1-assignment-sequence). A quick note about Think, ESF, and PWR courses: some courses are considerably more demanding than others despite being the same number of units, so reading Carta reviews can be useful!

WAYS Requirements: If you have extra space in your schedule, consider taking a class that fulfils a certain WAYS requirement. Don't worry too much about this during frosh year, but it can be useful to know what the requirements are and where they'll roughly fit into your undergraduate career. [https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways/about-ways](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways/about-ways)

Final Note: Take courses you enjoy, do things you love, and be true to yourself. You got into Stanford for a reason, and remember, that reason is different from everyone else's. Some weeks will be harder than others, some quarters might not go to plan, but keep at it with an open mind and a willingness to work hard, and you'll thrive here at Stanford.

Had a very non traditional route -&gt;govt-&gt;specialized consulting 

not stanford affiliated in anyway but wanted to apply to the ms there. if not this year in the future. I want to work for a company where tech is the core of my day to day activity instead of in finance/insurance like I am right now as a consultant. I generally like programming and stats and am thinking of taking an NDO to prepare for t hat.

1) out of curiosity what are the highest acceptance rates from what people have heard for stanford masters? I imagine there aint much difference but i thought i'd ask in case there may be some programs that might have a reasonable acceptance rate and are reachable. My interests include economics, finance, near eastern languages, and cs.

2) if I don't have research experience (did premed research for a year in undergrad and had a capstone for another masters I did). Work in NYC. How can I possibly get a remote research position at Stanford? A lot of the CS specialities aren’t really strong here in the NYC area. I am not a student currently and have been working, which seems atypical for research positions.

3) Taking NDO courses seems to be risky, as there isn’t much pay off or guarantee as far as Masters admissions. Took Calc in a T10 undergrad. Haven’t really taken done linear algebra which is a requirement for the MSEng. Should I jump into Math52? It’s difficult because you can go two or three elvels  into preqrequisites based on stanfords class listing requirement. The Stanford counselors don’t seem helpful in this regard in helping you choose courses and just refer you to the ‘pre-requisites’ which for programs like MSCS aren’t clear.

So if you can see my dilemma: on one hand Math52 is a pre-req to a program I’m interested in and yet I like other courses such as those that can help me in interviewing (data structures algorithms 106A

) or jobs (ie networking). So which NDO courses should I take pre-reqs or something just to prove my chops? Should I take one or two just to get a good grade and prove I have the chops?

I'm an incoming international Frosh and I plan to major in CS. During high school, I was enrolled in my country's own board so I don't really have AP credits. When I checked the CS course requirements in explore degrees, it's stated there that I need to either take Math 19, 20, and 21 or waive that requirement with AP credits.

Now, I've taken my placement test and it recommends me to take Math 51 but I'm at least planning to take Math 21 to fill in a few knowledge gaps as well. However, do I really need to take Math 19 and 20 as well? Cause that kinda feels basic and a lot of other STEM majors that I'm interested in as well require the 51 sequence only, so in that sense, CS seems to be a black sheep in the engineering department. Later, if I change my major, the Math 19 sequence wouldn't really count to the new major's math requirement.

I am literally so conflicted as to what I should be majoring in because quite honestly, there are way too many things that I am interested in at Stanford.

My original plan was to double major (CS + Mechanical Engineering or CS + Econ) with CS being the primary major as I heard that CS is one of the most valuable degrees that you can get at Stanford. However, I heard today that CS and MechE have a lot of courses in common that you can't count twice for both majors.

I thought about CS + Econ as well (with Econ first as a minor), but somebody told me that the Econ major is literally the Econ minor + some more electives. I thought about doing that, but I heard the CS major is pretty intensive in units and I'm worried I wouldn't be able to satisfy my WAYS requirements if I did this.

Also a note about coterms: I'm definitely hoping to do one - I was planning originally to do a CS Major and either Econ/MechE double major, and then do MS&amp;E as my coterm major. However, I was told that it might be a better idea to do MechE or Econ major and then coterm in CS... what should I do?

If it helps, I definitely hope to go into either tech entrepreneurship and eventually finance (Investment Banking, Venture Capital, or consulting). I helped launch a startup this summer, which made me realize the value of an education in CS and MechE. However, is an econ degree really necessary to work in finance?

I hear so many great things about the Frosh year at Stanford. And being someone who comes from a high school of 70 kids, with a senior class of 18, in a town without much to do,  I never really had much experience even being a teenager or doing teenager things like simply going out with friends. My friends were all from school but none of us were especially close and we were all pretty focused on school + extracurriculars + getting into good colleges.

I was lucky enough to be granted on-campus housing so I'll be able to live there with other students, but in my gut it still all just feels like a let down because of the virus. This was going to be the first time in my life I would even have the opportunity to have any semblance of ""fun"" or close-nit friendships.

People tell me that I should be grateful that I'm going to *\~\~Stanford\~\~*, or that it's going to be great any way because it's *\~\~Stanford\~\~*, or that at the end of the day I only have good decisions to make (on whether to gap or not) because it's *\~\~Stanford\~\~*, but it just doesn't feel that way to me.

I wanted to have a Frosh dorm experience, I wanted to be one of the people in those pictures on the Stanford website where they're all standing arms together, I wanted to be able to form connections with people, I wanted some amount of adventure after years of feeling burnt out from the tedium of driving to school, doing work, driving to extra curriculars, and driving home. I fear that after years of waiting for college to come, the rug has been swept out from under me.

it's ironic because i know the guy and he knows absolutely nothing about programming. He wrote his first line of code less than a year ago in an intro class and he usually never knew what to do. It was interesting to watch this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VSJSONhr90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VSJSONhr90) because it appears that he's trying to build a spurious reputation for himself as an experienced CS programmer when he really isn't. He also falsely claims he's ""built many other web apps and apps"" which is weird if your first language was python that you learned some months ago. From what I know he followed along some PHP Developer course on Coursera or Udemy. The other weird thing is that he seems to be paraphrasing zuckerberg, sometimes verbatim, like ""expanding to 100+ schools"". The fact that he used archaic tech like PHP/SQL exemplifies this since anyone with any experience would know this tech is outdated. Even if you used these tools you have to be very careful about guarding against exploits, most of which are well documented since PHP and SQL are so old.

And don't tell me financial aid, since I did their calculations, and it said I'd pay like 50K a year.

EDIT: My parents cannot afford/are not willing to meaningfully contribute, yet they'll charge me over 200K over 4-years, and I'll owe interest on loans. **We are all poor because we are all 17 and 18. I have 4 figures in the bank, and this school costs 6. Yet I'm offered paltry aid.**

Do you just accept not having financial security and independence for like a decade, since your interest builds up?

Do you expect to hit it big in the Bay Area in the five years after graduation?

You can live indefinitely off 4% of your savings and be forever financially independent (until you start having kids, and then your expenses are more than 4%). But this is basically impossible if you take 200K in loans with interest, unless you hit it big, which is very unlikely. **Are the opportunities for an** ***undergrad*** **and the faculty/mentoring and other students so great that it would be it to go here instead of Macaulay Honors CUNY, which is free?**",stanford,How do you afford this school?,0.0,0.31
