I hope you're all well and staying healthy.

I am currently beginning my search for graduate programs to apply to and I discovered from a very simple Google search that Yale University is ranked as one of the best schools for graduate art programs. For current students and alumni, how accurate is this?

For context, I am an Asian immigrant, a woman, DACA recipient, have a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Texas at Austin (Matthew McConaughey frequents the journalism buildings and I once rode the elevator with him), and currently working as Assistant Editor at a local book publishing company in Austin, Texas. I also have bylines published in *Texas Monthly*. From my research online, I think the best option for me would be the Terminal Master's Degree Program in English and Literature because I'm not looking to pursue a PhD and quite frankly cannot afford the tuition.

I guess I am just wondering whether the Terminal Degree Program at Yale is worth pursuing and how it compares to other ranked universities. In addition, since Yale has an incredibly slim acceptance rate, what can an applicant do to stand out?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

I was doing some casual research into possible opportunities in the summer of ‘22 (again not looking seriously into it, just looking ahead). Several that stood out to me were unpaid. 

To my understanding, undergrads can fund underpaid experiences domestically with the domestic summer award, and with grants/fellowships. However, as a student on financial aid, I am forced to make money over the summers (3200 or so I believe). Is it impossible for me to take on full-time unpaid opportunities as a result? I have to make money somehow, and I wouldn’t be making any by simply using grant money to do unpaid work. 

Am I missing something? I’m also confused how I would afford the study abroad programs with the ISA if I am still required to make money over the summer (would I have to be employed part-time during it?).

* STEM majors, how has it been learning at a school that's known for focusing on humanities?
* How has your experience in the New Haven area been?
* Is there a ""superiority"" complex among students with regards to Harvard? That's the vibe I've gotten from admitted students chats so far.

Hey everyone! I was accepted to Yale REA and think I'll commit soon. It's my dream school and I can't see myself anywhere else. But, I wanted to see if anyone on this sub could help inform me before I make a final decision.

Firstly, I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to major in, but I know it will be in either chemistry or biology. As of now, I'm probably doing Molecular Biophysics &amp; Biochemistry. But, I have no clue what I want to do as a career, and wouldn't be surprised if I decided to switch to an Econ or Data Science/Stats major. The thing I liked about Yale was the ability to easily switch majors, I know some schools are tough since you have to transfer between colleges, but that's not the case at Yale.

Yale is also a very humanities-heavy school, but from what I've read, it's been pouring A LOT into improving its STEM programs. I don't see this as a large issue, since I enjoy humanities as much as STEM, just can't see myself majoring in anything non-STEM. The reason I didn't apply to a school like MIT is b/c I value the importance of a liberal arts education that Yale provides. Yale seems like a great school for general science (biology, physics, chem, etc. which I hope to do). It also seems like there are endless opportunities for research which interest me as well. Could anyone that's majoring in STEM talk about their experiences?

Finally, more general stuff. How's New Haven? Do you find yourself stuck in a ""Yale bubble"" or do you get the chance to explore? Do you connect with students from surrounding colleges at all?

The financial aid was great, so that’s not a concern. My family wants me to commit as well.

The “problem” (extremely good problem to have, I almost feel bad even worrying about an acceptance to YALE) is that I’m a STEM student.

I do have interests outside of math/science, and loved the idea of getting to know a variety of people in Yale residential colleges and having a liberal arts education. However, everything I’ve read says Yale isn’t that strong in STEM. 

I know at this caliber (for undergrad especially?) the distinctions of the relative strengths of the fields aren’t THAT relevant, but I keep feeling like I might be ill advised not trying for Stanford and Princeton (as a potential engineering student) even though I like Yale more... do any STEM students at Yale have something to say about the strength of stem, why you chose Yale as a stem student, etc?

I was accepted tonight as a transfer to Yale!! I am very excited as when I applied the first time it was my first choice.

I spent the past year on a leave of absence from my college pursuing my professional acting and recorded music careers, which have both made me happier than I've ever been. I decided to transfer from my previous institution because there was no artistic community / available courses in acting/playwriting/recorded music, and it was too far away from LA auditions (2-2.5 hours 1 way). I was also accepted to Columbia University (a school that I have more friends at and am way more acquainted with) and am now tasked with the difficult decision between the two. If I was at Yale, would I feasibly be able to continue auditioning in NYC with my agency and not have to put my career on pause for 3 years? At Yale, would I get stronger connections/ inroads to the industry than at Columbia? Stronger training? Additionally, I've heard nothing about people at Yale pursuing a career in recorded (pop) music. Is there a community of non-classical musicians/producers on campus?  Any advice is appreciated!!

On the other hand, I’ve heard many math classes - complex analysis, topology, differential geometry, partial diffeqs, Lie groups, functional analysis - are recommended/essential for theoretical physics. I’m also curious about the “math for physics” courses, could these supplement or replace any of the above to make room for grad courses?

Essentially, would I be better prepared with a slew of math courses or a few physics grad courses in areas I plan to pursue (both in addition to the intensive phys major)?

There is a good chance that there won't be in-person classes in the fall. Nobody knows for sure, but it's pretty likely at this point and departments are preparing for it. Don't waste your tuition money on really overpriced webinars from Yale. Wait a year to come, and then get four full years of Yale.

0.0,1587748235.0,19.0,yale,"Edit: thanks for all the advice, I decided to commit to Stanford

Hi everyone! I was extremely lucky to be admitted to both of these great schools. I've been agonizing over this decision for the last month and still haven't come to a final decision. There are things I love and dislike about both schools, and I think I would be happy at either. I'll try my best to outline what I see to be the advantages and disadvantages of Stanford vs. Yale in Academics, Student Experience, and Career Outcomes as they relate to my interests and goals- please correct me if you disagree with any of my assessments and lmk if you have relevant info/experiences!

**Academics:** *I am interested in Analytic Philosophy and CS/logic. Right now, I think I want to study both of these fields in college, but I am very open to exploring new areas.*

* Obviously, the overall quality of education is pretty much the same at both of these schools.
* Stanford’s strengths and resources are tilted towards STEM, while Yale’s are tilted towards the humanities. The majors I’m interested in at each school are Symbolic Systems at Stanford and Math + Philosophy at Yale. Both of these programs seem like they leverage their school’s institutional strengths well.
* At Stanford, it looks like it’s much easier to get a master’s degree with your bachelor’s in 4 years, which is something I would like to do. (thinking of Symsys BS with CS coterm)
* At Yale, it seems easier to double major than at Stanford, which isn’t too important to me, but I would want to do this if I can’t get a master’s degree.
* Both schools have grade inflation, but it looks like inflation is more prevalent at Yale.

**Student Experience/Culture:** *I grew up in the south and attended high school at an elite prep school in the northeast. I'm looking for a new, exciting college experience that pushes me to challenge myself and grow*

* Stanford has better weather and a more exciting location in SV. A lot more appealing to me than crime-ridden, cold, economically depressed New Haven
* Yale might have a friendlier, more open social scene due to residential colleges, as opposed to Stanford, which I’ve heard is cliquey.
* It seems like Stanford is less elitist/stuffy, which I see as a refreshing departure from my high school experience.
* I feel like I might fit in better socially at Stanford as an Asian dude who's not from an elite family.
* My impression is that Stanford's culture is more pre-professional than Yale's, which I appreciate.
* I don't like how Stanford seems very STEM-dominated, especially as someone whose primary interest lies outside of the natural sciences. Yale seems to have more diversity of academic interests, which I like.

**Career Outcomes:** *I’m not sure what I want to do as a career, but I’ll probably either go into Consulting/Tech/Finance or off to Law School (like most people at these schools lmao)*

* Name Brand- virtually the same overall (will open most of the same doors), but my impression is Stanford fares better on the west coast and internationally, while Yale’s brand is stronger on the east coast.
* It seems to me that Stanford, being a younger school, doesn’t have the same deep roots that Yale does in fields dominated by old money / HYP, such as Wall Street and Politics
* Yale’s network is stronger in Wall Street, Government, and Law, while Stanford’s network is stronger in High Tech, VC, and Business.
* Yale’s alumni are largely concentrated in NYC, and Stanford’s alumni are mostly in the Bay Area. I can see myself working in either area.

Overall, I think Stanford and Yale will serve me equally well academically and in my future career. Based on the school cultures/expected student experience, I'm leaning towards Stanford right now b/c of its better location, more down-to-earth students, and the exciting prospect of moving away from what I'm used to in the northeast.

I'm sure I made many incorrect statements and am missing many other dimensions to consider- please correct me and share your relevant info/experiences!",Please help a conflicted prospective student to decide: Yale vs. Stanford,t3_g7c8iv,19.0,0.88,invertedfractal

Today I got an email from the Eli Whitney Program team about setting up an interview in a few weeks (Zoom, of course). I was just seeing if you guys have any advice as well as answers to a few questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

First off, how much stock should I even be putting into the fact I got an interview in the first place? I want to be excited because, from what I've seen, they handpick people for it but I can't find a good source to confirm that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, what would the 'tone' of the interview be? I did one with Harvard a few days ago and it was a really friendly interview with a pretty wide range of questions (personal life, background, academic/non-academic interests, future plans, why 'X' school, etc.). Is it safe to say it will be pretty similar? 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, in my spare time, I read a LOT of works that have to do with the topic I'm hoping to major in (Global Affairs) and I try to stick to respected scholars and publications. I'm honestly just a massive nerd for the subject and I enjoy reading about it constantly. Assuming that it's something relevant to the questions being asked, would it seem too 'try-hard' to bring this up? I really am the type of person who uses their free time to read books by academics, but I don't want to talk about it if it makes me come across as inauthentic or that I believe that I know it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, what are just some general pitfalls people often fall into or things they tend to omit that they should have emphasized more? Or really, just any advice in general, unironically I don't know shit so I'll take any wisdom that comes my way.

I graduated high school last year and deferred my admission to Yale (and my pre-admission to DS). My gap year has been eye opening but I fear that my writing skills have atrophied.

I went to a private school and learned to churn out analytical papers. The last time I wrote an argumentative paper, however, was 10 months ago. If I were quoting today I'd probably need Google to get the formatting right. I'm worried that, compared to my peers fresh out of school, I'll be starting behind. 

I'm back home now and have to sharpen up. 

Do you have any specific tips for tackling DS papers or resources for college writing in general? What about advice for how to practice academic writing on my own.

Dear YSM Faculty:

In follow-up to recent communications from President Salovey, Provost Strobel, and me, basic science chairs and directors convened today to discuss the meaning of critical or essential work in the laboratory setting. As the situation on-the-ground around COVID evolves, so must our definition of critical and essential functions in the laboratory.

As always, the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and patients are our priority.

At this time, examples of critical laboratory work include research on the causes and mechanisms of viral (COVID-19) infection; therapeutic clinical research studies; monitoring of the safety and efficacy of patients in ongoing clinical trials; testing of patient/research samples for ongoing clinical trials that cannot be paused; and other lab work that impacts the immediate safety and health of our patients and community. Preservation of precious resources such as cell lines or animals so as to avoid the disruption of months or years of work may also be viewed as critical, in which case specific team members should be identified to maintain these resources and complete critical experiments.

Investigators or lab members should not come to work if they are having symptoms, and all should practice social distancing. It is important to note that investigators can be very productive while working from home. Some have expressed concerns about the impact of decreased productivity on their life’s work and career development; please know that the university and YSM will be developing a policy to extend the tenure clock commensurate with the duration of interruptions.

More detailed information regarding human subjects research can be viewed here.

\-  When spring recess ends and through April 5 at the earliest, classes will be held using Zoom, Canvas, or other online tools. I know classes take many forms across the university, so this shift to online teaching and learning raises many questions. Deans will be communicating with their faculty and students to provide further details in the days ahead. 

\-  We are asking Yale College students to remain at home after spring recess. For undergraduates who are on campus now, please make every effort to return home as soon as possible, and no later than Sunday, March 15. Yale College Dean Marvin Chun will be providing additional details in the coming days. Undergraduates will have the support of the university in meeting their academic requirements remotely while at home. I understand that some undergraduates consider New Haven to be their home or cannot leave the university at this time. The Yale College Dean’s Office will provide separate instructions for these students, who also will take their classes online.

Graduate and professional students are encouraged to remain off-campus and participate in online instruction, unless required to be on campus due to the nature of their research or academic programs. More information is forthcoming from the deans of each school.

I am considering the Computer Science PhD program at Yale. Could someone help me with few questions about funding at Yale?

Source of funding:

* Does the program funds for all \~5 years or the adviser funds (after finding one)?
* What fraction of PhD students TA? I have seen that students in less glamorous fields like Theory tend to TA.

Stipend:

* How much is the total PhD stipend for a regular student before all deductions?
   * During the regular Fall and Spring semester.
   * During the Summer semester.
* Are there any out of pocket mandatory fees - say for the shuttles, gym, etc?

Could not find this info [here](http://www.phdstipends.com/results).

Housing and others:

* For how many years does Yale provide subsidized graduate housing?
* Does Yale provide vision and dental for free or subsidized?

0.0,1571410597.0,5.0,yale," For the [**sixth semester in a row**](https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/Yale-says-sexual-misconduct-complaints-increase-14456597.php), sexual misconduct reports have gone up at Yale University, [**double the number**](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/) from spring 2017.

And the Yale official responsible for compiling the report seems to regard these rising numbers as a positive development.

“We are hopeful that the increase in complaints reported to the University is an indication that our community is more aware of and more frequently accessing our resources,” Stephanie Spangler, Title IX coordinator and deputy provost for health affairs and academic integrity, told the [***Yale Daily News***](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/)*.*

Some of those analyzing the [**recent semi-annual report**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Sexual%20Misconduct%20Report%20Jan-Jun%202019.pdf) are skeptical of the high numbers, however, largely due to the broad definitions for terms such as sexual harassment and sexual assault.

With 169 claims filed from January through June alone, the Ivy League school would have a “much higher violent crime rate than any of the nation’s most dangerous cities” if the report is to be believed, Brooklyn College Prof. KC Johnson, who chronicles Title IX enforcement at colleges nationwide, wrote in a recent analysis.

The broad definitions have real consequences for students’ rights, according to Samantha Harris, vice president for procedural advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

“By giving the impression that the university is a hotbed of violent sexual crimes,” she told*The College Fix* in an email, “a broad definition like this fosters the type of climate of fear that has led to the wholesale abandonment of due process in campus sexual misconduct adjudications. It also trivializes real sex crimes.”

Yale did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls from *The Fix* Oct. 8-14, asking for its response to Johnson’s analysis of the report, published in [***Minding the Campus***](https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2019/10/04/is-yale-more-dangerous-than-detroit/).

***‘Counseling’ is the common response to sexual misconduct***

Johnson is a [**recurring critic**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/yales-latest-report-on-its-sexual-misconduct-investigations-shows-more-curiosities/) of the so-called Spangler reports. He noted that despite the huge number of reported cases, “only five sexual assault cases were adjudicated” during the most recent six-month period.

Four of the five accused students were found guilty, yet the punishments – including short suspensions or probation – “suggest the actual offense was far less severe than the commonly understood definition of sexual assault,” he wrote.

Johnson also pointed out that Spangler has “removed more and more details from her reports” over the years, including details of “third-party reports involving anonymous alleged victims and accused students.”

The report, released in mid-September, is the 16th since 2012. It covers sexual misconduct reports to Yale Title IX coordinators, the Yale Police Department, and the [**University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct**](https://provost.yale.edu/uwc/procedures) for the first six months of the calendar year.

The half-year report, like its predecessors, “illustrates the danger of lumping everything from groping to forcible rape under the umbrella term ‘sexual assault,’” said Harris, whose work with FIRE concerns issues of free speech and due process on campus.

“If one reads the report, one sees that the university commonly responds to reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault simply by ‘counsel\[ing\] the respondent on appropriate conduct’ — including in response to reports of penetration without consent!” she told *The Fix*, highlighting pages 10 and 11 of the report:

&gt;If counseling respondents is truly the university’s response to rape, that is grossly inadequate — but what I suspect this actually reflects is the university’s use of an ambiguous and confusing “affirmative consent” definition, under which sex is not consensual unless there is “positive, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement to engage in specific sexual activity throughout a sexual encounter,” which must be re-affirmed for each new sexual act and which can be “revoked at any time.”

Harris argues that definitions such as these are “likely to engender a great deal of confusion among participants in sexual encounters.”

After New York approved an [**affirmative consent law**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/law-professors-line-up-against-new-yorks-new-campus-sexual-assault-law/) that applies only to colleges, FIRE [**interviewed local students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/) about it, Harris noted, learning that “they found the definition highly confusing and were uncertain about what was now prohibited.

“In light of these broad definitions, it is perhaps not surprising that Yale has been the subject of at least 6 lawsuits brought by students accused of sexual misconduct,” she said, “alleging they were denied a fair process in their on-campus judicial proceedings.”

**MORE**: [**New York affirmative consent law baffles students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/)

***Yale more dangerous for female grad students than for undergrads?***

Further analysis of the report shows that 146 of the misconduct claims went to the Title IX office, which handles informal resolution, while only seven went to the university-wide committee, which actually adjudicates complaints.

The average age of reporting students has risen, both at Yale and nationally, according to Johnson. He attributes this trend to older students having attended college in an “accuser-friendly Title IX environment.”

If valid, this trend would indicate that Yale “becomes more dangerous for female students as they age out of the 18-24-year-old cohort.”

In the Yale cohort of the Association of American Universities’ 2015 “[**climate survey**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/WestatReportYaleUniversity-1.pdf)” on sexual assault and misconduct, 16.1 percent of Yale students reported they had experienced an attempted or completed act of sexual misconduct. Spangler is one of the credited designers of this [**national survey**](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/%40%20Files/Climate%20Survey/AAU_Campus_Climate_Survey_12_14_15.pdf), which will release 2019 results later this year.

Yale might not be alone in the Ivy League when it comes to a spike in reported sexual misconduct.

Last week Harvard University announced the debut of an anonymous Title IX reporting form, following apparent interest from the student body. It will allow students to submit Title IX complaints against anyone at Harvard with no trace back to themselves.

[***The Harvard Crimson***](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/8/title-ix-anonymous/#.XZycnWshBfU.twitter) notes that the rollout “follows the Government Department Committee on Climate Change’s recommendation that Harvard institute an anonymous reporting system in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez.”

Asked if he saw a connection between the new Harvard reporting system and the high number of complaints at Yale, Johnson told *The Fix* in an email that the two situations weren’t connected but rather “problematic for their own reasons.”

“Harvard raises issues \[because\] it allows anonymous complaints by witnesses \[with an\] explicit statement that the \[accused\] party won’t learn of the allegation,” he said. In an aside, Johnson said Harvard’s system “is already less fair than Yale’s, which is saying something.”

The core problem with Yale’s system is the “extremely broad definition of sexual assault” combined with Spangler’s practice of “leaving readers with the implication that all of these allegations have been adjudicated and upheld, even though only a tiny percentage of them are,” he said.

i’m a first year still figuring out my course schedule and i have narrowed it down to a few options. 

Thus far, I have only really decided on the following three courses:

Calc 115 ( calc 2) 
Chem 174 ( First year orgo) 
Chem 222La ( lab for organic chem) 
The History of World History ( First year seminar)

I am having difficulty choosing my fourth course. i want something that is easy considering how hard the rest of my schedule is. 

My current contenders are the following: 

Fren130 ( L30 french with Ruth Koizim) 
Econ 110 ( seminar of intro to microeconomics) 
Econ 115 ( into to microeconomics) 
Bio 101 ( intro to bio) 

i don’t want to take french this semester because of how hard the professor makes the course sound; in addition to meeting everyday, Koizim proudly declared that she would be assigning 90-120 minutes of homework every night, which i feel would be too much considering my other classes. 

I have heard that it is better to take Bio during the off cycle. 

Anyway, i would love to hear your thoughts on what my fourth course should be. i want to have a schedule that would keep me busy but also allow me time to have a social life and delve into extracurricular activities. And because i am currently considering attending medical school, it is necessary that i do well in my classes.

While I am attracted to the proximity with some of Yale’s best professors, the seminar learning environment, and the close knit community that DS platforms, I just don’t feel very interested by the summer reading and have been bored to death by the Iliad. My academic interests, as of now, lean more towards the history and literature of MENA and south east asia and the legacy of colonialism. That is not to say that i plan on avoiding the classics through my undergraduate career though.  I also feel hesitant to dive into what seems to be a rigorous program during my first year at Yale when I would rather be gathering my bearings and investing time into my social life.

I worry, however, that by not doing DS i wouldn’t be availing the best of what yale has to offer and that i would miss out on a community of DS students that’d make for some wonderful friends. Also, it seems that ex DSers are particularly well represented in programs such as the Brady-Johnson grand strategy program and selective majors, so i worry that if i decide not to DS i will be at a disadvantage and a weaker student in the eyes of my professors. 

tl; dr: will i have a harder time making friends if i’m not in DS and will i regret it later on in my undergraduate career?

I really want to attend Yale School of Arts, but if I go to Yale for undergrad, would that lessen my chances? 

Yale does have a great arts program, but it's mostly for graduate school. I talked with an art undergrad student and she said Yale is not great for undergrad art studies. Additionally, when I was there for BDD, there were no visual arts clubs at Yale. I'm between Yale and Stanford and I don't really like one over the other.

I heard FOOT is the most popular and that it fosters very intimate and long term bonds, which I love. It also sounds super fun. The bad thing is that it costs a bit and I won't get financial aid to cover it, and beyond the upfront $460 i would also need to purchase most of the equipment on the packing list (even though they say to just borrow things, no one I know is a big fan of hiking, so I can't).

I am willing to foot (no pun intended) the cost of FOOT if it is truly worth it over the other programs. 

On the other hand, it seems like Harvest is less popular. I've heard less about it and I don't even know the costs associated, but I love taking care of animals/animal husbandry and I'd love to experience farm life. I don't know if it fosters the same intimate connection that FOOT does though.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, this reads as an under-handed journalistic work. The   
report overly represents people who deem the Executive order to be   
""over-reaching."" Only one student is presented as a supporter of the   
Executive order. It also seems that there's a delusion on this campus   
that freedom of speech should be concerned about not making students   
uncomfortable. This is preposterous! Yale is supposed to be a space of   
intellectualism, where you face challenges from people with opposing   
views (yes, those views can make you uncomfortable), and draw your own. I  
 am very curious to find out how many students support the Executive   
order. If the YDN is curious too, it should send out a survey!

For activities, I am currently in a small orchestra at Brown and I am starting to run a magazine by myself. (I am also participating in a Christan fellowship group. However, this does not count anything.)

I applied to Yale as a freshman last year but got rejected. I was admitted by Tufts University and RISD and some other art schools.

0.0,1543639266.0,6.0,yale,"Hey Yale! Just wondering, did any of you get in Yale without any prestige awards, work under a ""famous professor"", and get fifteen 5's on AP tests? Pretty much 10/10 videos or blogs I have seen about people who got into Yale has completed this. I would love to study at Yale, as a a App. Math and Music student. My conductor went to Yale as well and went to the same high school as me. However, he is a LEGENDARY cellist, and had already knew Yale people. My school is not known for academics, as we have no AP courses, no honor courses, and is located in Vancouver Canada. I think my conductor is the only guy in my school that went straight to an IVY. He graduated in the 90's but the competition would still be tough back then. Pretty much everyone I've seen get in has accomplished something HUGE, or is super prestigious by their junior year in something. 

I know the cliche would be ""be yourself"", but from doing ""intensive"" research, the ""be yourself"" for many people who got in is pretty much all the things I described above. I self learned AP Calc and Phys in my sophomore year as I wanted to continue math but my school didn't offer it, I started a chamber band club which is turning into a official government approved class next year that counts for grades, I started a robotics class at my elementary school, I do orchestra and piano, volunteer at a elementary band, I am currently taking second  year math courses at a university, (currently in my junior year), and I am working on a math paper and do musical compositions as well. 

I am doing all that I love and striving to follow my dream which is to give back to the community as best as I can in every step of my life, and I know that many people say ""thats what matters"", but so far, everyone I see get in, has ""Eagle scout for 6 years"", or ""self-learned 20 APs with all 5s"", ""grew up in a poor abusive household and managed to win and lead international math olympiad"", ""working at local hospital"", or ""won 3 world-wide science fairs in a row"" or something on those lines.

My application is a lot better now and has been amended to better represent me as an applicant, but I’m worried that last year will hold me back.

0.0,1541413398.0,11.0,yale,"I'm an international student in South Korea (no US citizenship). I'm currently a junior.

I want to ask about the atmosphere at Yale since it is near impossible for me to actually visit American colleges regularly. This is going to be somewhat long, so bear with me, please!

I'm not sure what I want to major in yet, but currently, I have an interest in medicine and want to become a doctor (pathologist) someday. My counselor is recommending biology. However, I also love writing, doing research and studying non-science subjects, such as comparative politics and literature as well. I genuinely enjoy every subject I take except for Korean history. Students like me have trouble studying in the Korean curriculum because, starting from sophomore year, Korean students are forced to pick either a science curriculum or a non-science curriculum. This is the main reason why I wanted to study abroad.

I got the idea that even though Yale offers great science courses like MCDB, it emphasizes the arts and humanities. I yearn to take courses in literature, writing, and perhaps politics as well when I'm in college. Schools like MIT, Caltech, or Princeton, even though they are absolutely amazing (no doubt), doesn't really seem right for me because they are more science-orientated. Also, I'm tired of competing with everyone I study with. The Korean education system is extremely competitive, and kids fail to go into the college of their choice because they make a mistake or get one more question wrong in their school tests. This causes enmity and exasperation for everyone. I don't mind a little competition, but I want to study in an environment where people are willing to help each other and are less competitive or greedy.

First of all, is the atmosphere I'm picturing above accurate? If not, which schools in the US fit this picture? This is really important in making my college choice.

Second, does Yale care less for the science students compared to the humanities?

Third, Does Yale offer a lot of research opportunities for science majoring undergrads? I'm asking this because lots of US unis tend to focus more on graduate students.

Last, a lot of people say my ethnicity give me an advantage because lots of Asians have good stats. I have no idea if this is true. Based on your experience, what is an acceptable stat for an Asian female Yalie?

Only two people have gotten in Yale in our school so far, and it is depressing every time someone says nobody can go in because we're Asian. My current stats are sat 1540 (math 800, lang 740), Math 2 800, and three 5s for APs (comparative politics, psychology, micro). Straight As so far, and I am the top of my year. I took bio last weekend, and hopefully, it will be an okay score. I'm retaking SAT I this december. My stats are low because I starting considering studying abroad, and moved to an international school this February. Are my stats THAT BAD?

We do, however, plan to host more AMAs in the future! Follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, or sign up on our email list, to be notified of when our next AMA will take place.* 

MindMap is a New Haven based public education campaign hosted by the Program for Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP). We provide free, local and effective treatment for people who may be experiencing psychosis, as well as support for their families. We are a collaborative program of the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services and the Yale University Department of Psychiatry.

Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. Symptoms can include hallucinations, delusions, increased distractibility and withdrawal.

The goal of our campaign is early intervention. We want to spread awareness about the early warning signs of psychosis, so that people can receive help as soon as possible. First symptoms of psychosis most commonly appear between the ages of 18 and 24, the majority of fist episodes occurring between 13 and 30 years of age.

With this new semester starting, we wanted to give the Yale &amp; New Haven communities the opportunity to ask any questions that they may have about mental health, psychosis, symptoms or treatment. Please leave your questions here and I will be back to answer them. I look forward to chatting with many of you!

I'm an international from the UK who has just moved into Yale. 

I wanted to ask some questions to the community, so thought I would pool them concisely into one post - I hope that's OK! It's a bit of a leap starting up in a new country so these questions might sound dumb, but I just want to make sure I get things right.


1) Is there a good place to buy a bicycle? Ideally a decent second hand bike would be fine. But I'm not sure where to look, particularly for second hands. 

2) Which provider has best phone signal in Yale? I'll mainly be using data for everything (if not Wifi), and I'll mainly be in New Haven, NYC, or Boston for the next few years. So I'm looking for consistent good phone data, and not too pricey. 

3) What bank could people recommend to set up a simple checking account, just to move money in, use it to pay with a card (debit), take cash out, and occasionally receive money? I've seen Bank of America's everywhere - are they user friendly for a simple checking account?


Thanks for all the advice, and sorry if it's all a bit obvious - everything is strange and new for me and your advice is much appreciated.

I've also heard that the placement test is extremely difficult. I reread the Barron's AP Bio book, but apparently much of the placement test material goes beyond the scope of the AP curriculum. How should I go about studying? Thanks!

EDIT Post-Exam: This may have been the most ridiculous exam I've ever taken. The test questions are completely unrelated to the topics the module ostensibly covers. Which isn't to say the questions, if you can even call them that, are difficult conceptually. The content is standard, but the questions just cryptic and meaningless. Often they just make a vague assertion and the impetus is on you justify it. But there's a 2 sentence limit (yes, that's a thing--as if longer, ie. 3 or more sentence, answers are wrong), so you better hope that you read the grader's mind and those 2 sentences were *exactly* what they were looking for because you only get one shot. This whole test is basically an exercise in just Googling random specific things (not necessarily even related to the course material) quickly such that you have enough time to summarize the answer stated explicitly on some random Wikipedia article from 12 sentences into 2 to adhere to the sentence limit and sufficiently obfuscate the content to avoid plagiarism. 30 minutes to do 11 unrelated, arbitrary Google Search summaries, no biology expertise evaluated whatsoever.

I'm a prefrosh deciding whether to enroll in Math 120 or 230 in the fall, and also physics 200 or 260.

My background in math is quite good, and I'm comfortable with proofs. However, I've had limited exposure to multivariable calc as a whole.

As for physics, I'm very well versed in theory, and physics proofs/theory are what interest me the most about the subject. Yet, I'm slightly lacking in my ability to solve physics problems because I've only ever self-studied physics.

Any thoughts are appreciated.

Sincerely,
A confused prefrosh",Math 120/230 and Physics 200/260,t3_8vggio,10.0,1.0,johnnygodfather
