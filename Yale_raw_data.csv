I was admitted EA to Yale and I have a few questions about directed studies.  I'm probably going to major in Economics or something related to economics (I doubt EPE but possibly the dual Math and Econ major) and I somewhat like the idea of DS.  I am not a particularly voracious reader but I don't mind reading a good amount for this class.  I have always been more of a math kid but I'm a very good writer and have an interest in history and would like a strong foundation in the humanities.  I don't know if my schedule should be so hamstrung by DS in my first year though.  Any advice from someone who's taken it would be appreciated.  Cheers!",yale,DS for an econ major?,8.0,0.83

1. was financial aid a problem for anyone? i’m honestly quite clueless on the college admissions process and completely blanked on doing financial aid until right before decisions came out, so i still don’t have my finaid letter. is there anyone who didn’t get what they were expecting/hoping for, or is that reliable enough to be a nonfactor? 
2. i’ve always been a straight A student, but i’m really not looking forward to a couple of my courses next semester and i’m paranoid that i might not perform as well in them as i usually do. just as an estimate, how far would i have to spiral for Yale to retract my offer of admission?

* How has your experience in the New Haven area been?
* Is there a ""superiority"" complex among students with regards to Harvard? That's the vibe I've gotten from admitted students chats so far.

Hey everyone! I was accepted to Yale REA and think I'll commit soon. It's my dream school and I can't see myself anywhere else. But, I wanted to see if anyone on this sub could help inform me before I make a final decision.

Firstly, I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to major in, but I know it will be in either chemistry or biology. As of now, I'm probably doing Molecular Biophysics &amp; Biochemistry. But, I have no clue what I want to do as a career, and wouldn't be surprised if I decided to switch to an Econ or Data Science/Stats major. The thing I liked about Yale was the ability to easily switch majors, I know some schools are tough since you have to transfer between colleges, but that's not the case at Yale.

Yale is also a very humanities-heavy school, but from what I've read, it's been pouring A LOT into improving its STEM programs. I don't see this as a large issue, since I enjoy humanities as much as STEM, just can't see myself majoring in anything non-STEM. The reason I didn't apply to a school like MIT is b/c I value the importance of a liberal arts education that Yale provides. Yale seems like a great school for general science (biology, physics, chem, etc. which I hope to do). It also seems like there are endless opportunities for research which interest me as well. Could anyone that's majoring in STEM talk about their experiences?

Finally, more general stuff. How's New Haven? Do you find yourself stuck in a ""Yale bubble"" or do you get the chance to explore? Do you connect with students from surrounding colleges at all?

The financial aid was great, so that’s not a concern. My family wants me to commit as well.

The “problem” (extremely good problem to have, I almost feel bad even worrying about an acceptance to YALE) is that I’m a STEM student.

I know at this caliber (for undergrad especially?) the distinctions of the relative strengths of the fields aren’t THAT relevant, but I keep feeling like I might be ill advised not trying for Stanford and Princeton (as a potential engineering student) even though I like Yale more... do any STEM students at Yale have something to say about the strength of stem, why you chose Yale as a stem student, etc?

I was accepted tonight as a transfer to Yale!! I am very excited as when I applied the first time it was my first choice. However, I feel as though my life/ priorities have changed significantly since that point in time. I spent the past year on a leave of absence from my college pursuing my professional acting and recorded music careers, which have both made me happier than I've ever been. I decided to transfer from my previous institution because there was no artistic community / available courses in acting/playwriting/recorded music, and it was too far away from LA auditions (2-2.5 hours 1 way). I was also accepted to Columbia University (a school that I have more friends at and am way more acquainted with) and am now tasked with the difficult decision between the two. If I was at Yale, would I feasibly be able to continue auditioning in NYC with my agency and not have to put my career on pause for 3 years? At Yale, would I get stronger connections/ inroads to the industry than at Columbia? Stronger training? Additionally, I've heard nothing about people at Yale pursuing a career in recorded (pop) music. Is there a community of non-classical musicians/producers on campus?  Any advice is appreciated!! If you have any insight as to Yale's integration of transfer students that would be helpful too. Thank you, and sorry for the long post.

Hi everyone! I was extremely lucky to be admitted to both of these great schools. I've been agonizing over this decision for the last month and still haven't come to a final decision. There are things I love and dislike about both schools, and I think I would be happy at either. I'll try my best to outline what I see to be the advantages and disadvantages of Stanford vs. Yale in Academics, Student Experience, and Career Outcomes as they relate to my interests and goals- please correct me if you disagree with any of my assessments and lmk if you have relevant info/experiences!

**Academics:** *I am interested in Analytic Philosophy and CS/logic. Right now, I think I want to study both of these fields in college, but I am very open to exploring new areas.*

* Obviously, the overall quality of education is pretty much the same at both of these schools.
* Stanford’s strengths and resources are tilted towards STEM, while Yale’s are tilted towards the humanities. The majors I’m interested in at each school are Symbolic Systems at Stanford and Math + Philosophy at Yale. Both of these programs seem like they leverage their school’s institutional strengths well.
* At Stanford, it looks like it’s much easier to get a master’s degree with your bachelor’s in 4 years, which is something I would like to do. (thinking of Symsys BS with CS coterm)
* At Yale, it seems easier to double major than at Stanford, which isn’t too important to me, but I would want to do this if I can’t get a master’s degree.
* Both schools have grade inflation, but it looks like inflation is more prevalent at Yale.

**Student Experience/Culture:** *I grew up in the south and attended high school at an elite prep school in the northeast. I'm looking for a new, exciting college experience that pushes me to challenge myself and grow*

* Stanford has better weather and a more exciting location in SV. A lot more appealing to me than crime-ridden, cold, economically depressed New Haven
* Yale might have a friendlier, more open social scene due to residential colleges, as opposed to Stanford, which I’ve heard is cliquey.
* It seems like Stanford is less elitist/stuffy, which I see as a refreshing departure from my high school experience.
* I feel like I might fit in better socially at Stanford as an Asian dude who's not from an elite family.
* My impression is that Stanford's culture is more pre-professional than Yale's, which I appreciate.
* I don't like how Stanford seems very STEM-dominated, especially as someone whose primary interest lies outside of the natural sciences. Yale seems to have more diversity of academic interests, which I like.

**Career Outcomes:** *I’m not sure what I want to do as a career, but I’ll probably either go into Consulting/Tech/Finance or off to Law School (like most people at these schools lmao)*

* Name Brand- virtually the same overall (will open most of the same doors), but my impression is Stanford fares better on the west coast and internationally, while Yale’s brand is stronger on the east coast.
* It seems to me that Stanford, being a younger school, doesn’t have the same deep roots that Yale does in fields dominated by old money / HYP, such as Wall Street and Politics
* Yale’s network is stronger in Wall Street, Government, and Law, while Stanford’s network is stronger in High Tech, VC, and Business.
* Yale’s alumni are largely concentrated in NYC, and Stanford’s alumni are mostly in the Bay Area. I can see myself working in either area.

Overall, I think Stanford and Yale will serve me equally well academically and in my future career. Based on the school cultures/expected student experience, I'm leaning towards Stanford right now b/c of its better location, more down-to-earth students, and the exciting prospect of moving away from what I'm used to in the northeast.

First off, how much stock should I even be putting into the fact I got an interview in the first place? I want to be excited because, from what I've seen, they handpick people for it but I can't find a good source to confirm that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, what would the 'tone' of the interview be? I did one with Harvard a few days ago and it was a really friendly interview with a pretty wide range of questions (personal life, background, academic/non-academic interests, future plans, why 'X' school, etc.). Is it safe to say it will be pretty similar? 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, in my spare time, I read a LOT of works that have to do with the topic I'm hoping to major in (Global Affairs) and I try to stick to respected scholars and publications. I'm honestly just a massive nerd for the subject and I enjoy reading about it constantly. Assuming that it's something relevant to the questions being asked, would it seem too 'try-hard' to bring this up? I really am the type of person who uses their free time to read books by academics, but I don't want to talk about it if it makes me come across as inauthentic or that I believe that I know it all.

Dear YSM Faculty:

In follow-up to recent communications from President Salovey, Provost Strobel, and me, basic science chairs and directors convened today to discuss the meaning of critical or essential work in the laboratory setting. As the situation on-the-ground around COVID evolves, so must our definition of critical and essential functions in the laboratory.

As always, the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and patients are our priority.

At this time, examples of critical laboratory work include research on the causes and mechanisms of viral (COVID-19) infection; therapeutic clinical research studies; monitoring of the safety and efficacy of patients in ongoing clinical trials; testing of patient/research samples for ongoing clinical trials that cannot be paused; and other lab work that impacts the immediate safety and health of our patients and community. Preservation of precious resources such as cell lines or animals so as to avoid the disruption of months or years of work may also be viewed as critical, in which case specific team members should be identified to maintain these resources and complete critical experiments.

Investigators or lab members should not come to work if they are having symptoms, and all should practice social distancing. It is important to note that investigators can be very productive while working from home. Some have expressed concerns about the impact of decreased productivity on their life’s work and career development; please know that the university and YSM will be developing a policy to extend the tenure clock commensurate with the duration of interruptions.

More detailed information regarding human subjects research can be viewed here.

\-  When spring recess ends and through April 5 at the earliest, classes will be held using Zoom, Canvas, or other online tools. I know classes take many forms across the university, so this shift to online teaching and learning raises many questions. Deans will be communicating with their faculty and students to provide further details in the days ahead.

For undergraduates who are on campus now, please make every effort to return home as soon as possible, and no later than Sunday, March 15. Yale College Dean Marvin Chun will be providing additional details in the coming days. Undergraduates will have the support of the university in meeting their academic requirements remotely while at home.

The Yale College Dean’s Office will provide separate instructions for these students, who also will take their classes online.

1571410597.0,0.0,5.0," For the [**sixth semester in a row**](https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/Yale-says-sexual-misconduct-complaints-increase-14456597.php), sexual misconduct reports have gone up at Yale University, [**double the number**](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/) from spring 2017.

And the Yale official responsible for compiling the report seems to regard these rising numbers as a positive development.

“We are hopeful that the increase in complaints reported to the University is an indication that our community is more aware of and more frequently accessing our resources,” Stephanie Spangler, Title IX coordinator and deputy provost for health affairs and academic integrity, told the [***Yale Daily News***](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/)*.*

Some of those analyzing the [**recent semi-annual report**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Sexual%20Misconduct%20Report%20Jan-Jun%202019.pdf) are skeptical of the high numbers, however, largely due to the broad definitions for terms such as sexual harassment and sexual assault.

With 169 claims filed from January through June alone, the Ivy League school would have a “much higher violent crime rate than any of the nation’s most dangerous cities” if the report is to be believed, Brooklyn College Prof. KC Johnson, who chronicles Title IX enforcement at colleges nationwide, wrote in a recent analysis.

The broad definitions have real consequences for students’ rights, according to Samantha Harris, vice president for procedural advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

“By giving the impression that the university is a hotbed of violent sexual crimes,” she told*The College Fix* in an email, “a broad definition like this fosters the type of climate of fear that has led to the wholesale abandonment of due process in campus sexual misconduct adjudications. It also trivializes real sex crimes.”

Yale did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls from *The Fix* Oct. 8-14, asking for its response to Johnson’s analysis of the report, published in [***Minding the Campus***](https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2019/10/04/is-yale-more-dangerous-than-detroit/).

***‘Counseling’ is the common response to sexual misconduct***

Johnson is a [**recurring critic**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/yales-latest-report-on-its-sexual-misconduct-investigations-shows-more-curiosities/) of the so-called Spangler reports. He noted that despite the huge number of reported cases, “only five sexual assault cases were adjudicated” during the most recent six-month period.

Four of the five accused students were found guilty, yet the punishments – including short suspensions or probation – “suggest the actual offense was far less severe than the commonly understood definition of sexual assault,” he wrote.

Johnson also pointed out that Spangler has “removed more and more details from her reports” over the years, including details of “third-party reports involving anonymous alleged victims and accused students.”

The report, released in mid-September, is the 16th since 2012. It covers sexual misconduct reports to Yale Title IX coordinators, the Yale Police Department, and the [**University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct**](https://provost.yale.edu/uwc/procedures) for the first six months of the calendar year.

The half-year report, like its predecessors, “illustrates the danger of lumping everything from groping to forcible rape under the umbrella term ‘sexual assault,’” said Harris, whose work with FIRE concerns issues of free speech and due process on campus.

“If one reads the report, one sees that the university commonly responds to reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault simply by ‘counsel\[ing\] the respondent on appropriate conduct’ — including in response to reports of penetration without consent!” she told *The Fix*, highlighting pages 10 and 11 of the report:

&gt;If counseling respondents is truly the university’s response to rape, that is grossly inadequate — but what I suspect this actually reflects is the university’s use of an ambiguous and confusing “affirmative consent” definition, under which sex is not consensual unless there is “positive, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement to engage in specific sexual activity throughout a sexual encounter,” which must be re-affirmed for each new sexual act and which can be “revoked at any time.”

Harris argues that definitions such as these are “likely to engender a great deal of confusion among participants in sexual encounters.”

After New York approved an [**affirmative consent law**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/law-professors-line-up-against-new-yorks-new-campus-sexual-assault-law/) that applies only to colleges, FIRE [**interviewed local students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/) about it, Harris noted, learning that “they found the definition highly confusing and were uncertain about what was now prohibited.

“In light of these broad definitions, it is perhaps not surprising that Yale has been the subject of at least 6 lawsuits brought by students accused of sexual misconduct,” she said, “alleging they were denied a fair process in their on-campus judicial proceedings.”

**MORE**: [**New York affirmative consent law baffles students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/)

***Yale more dangerous for female grad students than for undergrads?***

Further analysis of the report shows that 146 of the misconduct claims went to the Title IX office, which handles informal resolution, while only seven went to the university-wide committee, which actually adjudicates complaints.

The average age of reporting students has risen, both at Yale and nationally, according to Johnson. He attributes this trend to older students having attended college in an “accuser-friendly Title IX environment.”

If valid, this trend would indicate that Yale “becomes more dangerous for female students as they age out of the 18-24-year-old cohort.”

In the Yale cohort of the Association of American Universities’ 2015 “[**climate survey**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/WestatReportYaleUniversity-1.pdf)” on sexual assault and misconduct, 16.1 percent of Yale students reported they had experienced an attempted or completed act of sexual misconduct. Spangler is one of the credited designers of this [**national survey**](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/%40%20Files/Climate%20Survey/AAU_Campus_Climate_Survey_12_14_15.pdf), which will release 2019 results later this year.

Yale might not be alone in the Ivy League when it comes to a spike in reported sexual misconduct.

Last week Harvard University announced the debut of an anonymous Title IX reporting form, following apparent interest from the student body. It will allow students to submit Title IX complaints against anyone at Harvard with no trace back to themselves.

[***The Harvard Crimson***](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/8/title-ix-anonymous/#.XZycnWshBfU.twitter) notes that the rollout “follows the Government Department Committee on Climate Change’s recommendation that Harvard institute an anonymous reporting system in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez.”

Asked if he saw a connection between the new Harvard reporting system and the high number of complaints at Yale, Johnson told *The Fix* in an email that the two situations weren’t connected but rather “problematic for their own reasons.”

“Harvard raises issues \[because\] it allows anonymous complaints by witnesses \[with an\] explicit statement that the \[accused\] party won’t learn of the allegation,” he said. In an aside, Johnson said Harvard’s system “is already less fair than Yale’s, which is saying something.”

The core problem with Yale’s system is the “extremely broad definition of sexual assault” combined with Spangler’s practice of “leaving readers with the implication that all of these allegations have been adjudicated and upheld, even though only a tiny percentage of them are,” he said.

i’m a first year still figuring out my course schedule and i have narrowed it down to a few options. 

Thus far, I have only really decided on the following three courses:

Calc 115 ( calc 2) 
Chem 174 ( First year orgo) 
Chem 222La ( lab for organic chem) 
The History of World History ( First year seminar)

I am having difficulty choosing my fourth course. i want something that is easy considering how hard the rest of my schedule is. 

My current contenders are the following: 

Fren130 ( L30 french with Ruth Koizim) 
Econ 110 ( seminar of intro to microeconomics) 
Econ 115 ( into to microeconomics) 
Bio 101 ( intro to bio) 

i don’t want to take french this semester because of how hard the professor makes the course sound; in addition to meeting everyday, Koizim proudly declared that she would be assigning 90-120 minutes of homework every night, which i feel would be too much considering my other classes. 

I have heard that it is better to take Bio during the off cycle. 

Anyway, i would love to hear your thoughts on what my fourth course should be. i want to have a schedule that would keep me busy but also allow me time to have a social life and delve into extracurricular activities.

While I am attracted to the proximity with some of Yale’s best professors, the seminar learning environment, and the close knit community that DS platforms, I just don’t feel very interested by the summer reading and have been bored to death by the Iliad. My academic interests, as of now, lean more towards the history and literature of MENA and south east asia and the legacy of colonialism. That is not to say that i plan on avoiding the classics through my undergraduate career though.  I also feel hesitant to dive into what seems to be a rigorous program during my first year at Yale when I would rather be gathering my bearings and investing time into my social life.

I worry, however, that by not doing DS i wouldn’t be availing the best of what yale has to offer and that i would miss out on a community of DS students that’d make for some wonderful friends. Also, it seems that ex DSers are particularly well represented in programs such as the Brady-Johnson grand strategy program and selective majors, so i worry that if i decide not to DS i will be at a disadvantage and a weaker student in the eyes of my professors. 

tl; dr: will i have a harder time making friends if i’m not in DS and will i regret it later on in my undergraduate career?

I simply know I want to use my education to serve underrepresented communities, whether it be by representation or direct action.

From what I have looked into Princeton, the Woodrow Wilson School seems like an extremely good match for me, but I connected more with the student orgs I have read about at Yale and the social issues of New Haven.

I heard FOOT is the most popular and that it fosters very intimate and long term bonds, which I love. It also sounds super fun. The bad thing is that it costs a bit and I won't get financial aid to cover it, and beyond the upfront $460 i would also need to purchase most of the equipment on the packing list (even though they say to just borrow things, no one I know is a big fan of hiking, so I can't).

I am willing to foot (no pun intended) the cost of FOOT if it is truly worth it over the other programs. 

On the other hand, it seems like Harvest is less popular. I've heard less about it and I don't even know the costs associated, but I love taking care of animals/animal husbandry and I'd love to experience farm life. I don't know if it fosters the same intimate connection that FOOT does though.

I've posted the comment in its entirety below. Am I being unreasonable? Am I not seeing something?

My comment to the YDN: 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, this reads as an under-handed journalistic work. The   
report overly represents people who deem the Executive order to be   
""over-reaching."" Only one student is presented as a supporter of the   
Executive order. It also seems that there's a delusion on this campus   
that freedom of speech should be concerned about not making students   
uncomfortable. This is preposterous! Yale is supposed to be a space of   
intellectualism, where you face challenges from people with opposing   
views (yes, those views can make you uncomfortable), and draw your own. I  
 am very curious to find out how many students support the Executive   
order. If the YDN is curious too, it should send out a survey!

I really want to major in both math and fine art. Only taking some math classes at Brown is not enough. I want to study art in a school which offers an art program that is as good as RISD and offers a whatever math program at the same time. So Yale is a good choice for me. I am planning to apply in my Sophomore year. I do not have impressive activities in high school. I was focusing on art application at that time. But most courses I took were math and physics.  

For activities, I am currently in a small orchestra at Brown and I am starting to run a magazine by myself. (I am also participating in a Christan fellowship group. However, this does not count anything.)

I applied to Yale as a freshman last year but got rejected. I was admitted by Tufts University and RISD and some other art schools.

My school is not known for academics, as we have no AP courses, no honor courses, and is located in Vancouver Canada. I think my conductor is the only guy in my school that went straight to an IVY. He graduated in the 90's but the competition would still be tough back then. Pretty much everyone I've seen get in has accomplished something HUGE, or is super prestigious by their junior year in something. 

I know the cliche would be ""be yourself"", but from doing ""intensive"" research, the ""be yourself"" for many people who got in is pretty much all the things I described above.

I want to ask about the atmosphere at Yale since it is near impossible for me to actually visit American colleges regularly. This is going to be somewhat long, so bear with me, please!

I'm not sure what I want to major in yet, but currently, I have an interest in medicine and want to become a doctor (pathologist) someday. My counselor is recommending biology. However, I also love writing, doing research and studying non-science subjects, such as comparative politics and literature as well. I genuinely enjoy every subject I take except for Korean history. Students like me have trouble studying in the Korean curriculum because, starting from sophomore year, Korean students are forced to pick either a science curriculum or a non-science curriculum. This is the main reason why I wanted to study abroad.

I got the idea that even though Yale offers great science courses like MCDB, it emphasizes the arts and humanities. I yearn to take courses in literature, writing, and perhaps politics as well when I'm in college. Schools like MIT, Caltech, or Princeton, even though they are absolutely amazing (no doubt), doesn't really seem right for me because they are more science-orientated. Also, I'm tired of competing with everyone I study with. The Korean education system is extremely competitive, and kids fail to go into the college of their choice because they make a mistake or get one more question wrong in their school tests. This causes enmity and exasperation for everyone. I don't mind a little competition, but I want to study in an environment where people are willing to help each other and are less competitive or greedy.

First of all, is the atmosphere I'm picturing above accurate? If not, which schools in the US fit this picture? This is really important in making my college choice.

Second, does Yale care less for the science students compared to the humanities?

Third, Does Yale offer a lot of research opportunities for science majoring undergrads? I'm asking this because lots of US unis tend to focus more on graduate students.

Last, a lot of people say my ethnicity give me an advantage because lots of Asians have good stats. I have no idea if this is true. Based on your experience, what is an acceptable stat for an Asian female Yalie?

Only two people have gotten in Yale in our school so far, and it is depressing every time someone says nobody can go in because we're Asian. My current stats are sat 1540 (math 800, lang 740), Math 2 800, and three 5s for APs (comparative politics, psychology, micro). Straight As so far, and I am the top of my year. I took bio last weekend, and hopefully, it will be an okay score. I'm retaking SAT I this december.

Considering the political demographics at Yale, I don't know how many of you will share my opinion.  I, for one, do not support Kavanaugh politically. To me, however, this isn't a partisan matter; it's a matter of the fundamental beliefs of our justice system. To allow this accusation to affect Kavanaugh's career is to weaponize any sexual assault accusation, even if it may be completely unsubstantiated.

We do, however, plan to host more AMAs in the future! Follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, or sign up on our email list, to be notified of when our next AMA will take place.* 

MindMap is a New Haven based public education campaign hosted by the Program for Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP). We provide free, local and effective treatment for people who may be experiencing psychosis, as well as support for their families. We are a collaborative program of the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services and the Yale University Department of Psychiatry.

Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. Symptoms can include hallucinations, delusions, increased distractibility and withdrawal.

The goal of our campaign is early intervention. We want to spread awareness about the early warning signs of psychosis, so that people can receive help as soon as possible. First symptoms of psychosis most commonly appear between the ages of 18 and 24, the majority of fist episodes occurring between 13 and 30 years of age.

With this new semester starting, we wanted to give the Yale &amp; New Haven communities the opportunity to ask any questions that they may have about mental health, psychosis, symptoms or treatment. Please leave your questions here and I will be back to answer them. I look forward to chatting with many of you!

EDIT Post-Exam: This may have been the most ridiculous exam I've ever taken. The test questions are completely unrelated to the topics the module ostensibly covers.

Often they just make a vague assertion and the impetus is on you justify it. But there's a 2 sentence limit (yes, that's a thing--as if longer, ie. 3 or more sentence, answers are wrong), so you better hope that you read the grader's mind and those 2 sentences were *exactly* what they were looking for because you only get one shot. This whole test is basically an exercise in just Googling random specific things (not necessarily even related to the course material) quickly such that you have enough time to summarize the answer stated explicitly on some random Wikipedia article from 12 sentences into 2 to adhere to the sentence limit and sufficiently obfuscate the content to avoid plagiarism. 30 minutes to do 11 unrelated, arbitrary Google Search summaries, no biology expertise evaluated whatsoever.

I'm a prefrosh deciding whether to enroll in Math 120 or 230 in the fall, and also physics 200 or 260.

My background in math is quite good, and I'm comfortable with proofs. However, I've had limited exposure to multivariable calc as a whole.

As for physics, I'm very well versed in theory, and physics proofs/theory are what interest me the most about the subject. Yet, I'm slightly lacking in my ability to solve physics problems because I've only ever self-studied physics.

Any thoughts are appreciated.
